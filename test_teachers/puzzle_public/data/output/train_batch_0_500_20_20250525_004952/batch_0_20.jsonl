{"question_id": "binairo_480", "response": "### 1. Restating the Puzzle and Rules\nWe are solving a Binairo puzzle with a 4x4 grid. The rules are:\n- Cells contain either 0 (blue) or 1 (red).\n- No more than two consecutive identical numbers horizontally or vertically.\n- Equal numbers of 0s and 1s in each row and column.\n- No two rows or columns are identical.\n\nFrom the image, we see:\n- Top row has a middle 1 (red).\n- Second row is empty (no numbers).\n- Third row has two consecutive 0s (blue) on the right.\n- Bottom row has 1 (red) at the far left and another 1 (red) at the far right.\n\n\n### 2. Extracting Information from Image\n- From the top row with a middle red square, the row must be `_ 1 _ _`.\n- The second row is empty and must follow all rules.\n- The third row has two blue squares, so it's `__ 00`.\n- The bottom row has red squares at both ends, making it `1 _ _ 1`.\n\n### 3. Option Analysis\n#### Option A:\n```\n0 1 1 0\n0 0 1 1\n1 1 0 0\n1 0 0 1\n```\n- Top row matches our deduction: `_ 1 _ _` becomes `0 1 1 0`.\n- Second row `0 0 1 1` is valid.\n- Third row matches `__ 00` as `1 1 0 0`.\n- Bottom row matches `1 _ _ 1` as `1 0 0 1`.\n- All rules are followed. No issues.\n\n#### Option B:\n```\n1 1 1 0\n0 0 1 1\n1 1 0 0\n1 0 0 1\n```\n- Decisive fact: Top row has three consecutive `1`s (`1 1 1 0`), violating the rule.\n\n#### Option C:\n```\n0 1 1 0\n0 0 1 1\n1 1 1 0\n1 0 0 1\n```\n- Decisive fact: Third row has three consecutive `1`s (`1 1 1 0`), violating the rule.\n\n#### Option D:\n```\n0 1 1 0\n0 0 1 1\n1 1 0 0\n1 0 0 0\n```\n- Decisive fact: Bottom row has three consecutive `0`s (`1 0 0 0`), violating the rule.\n\n### 4.

Restating the Puzzle and Rules:\nWe have a 4x4 Binairo puzzle where red cells represent '1' and blue cells represent '0'.

From the picture, we see the following colored pattern:\n\n- Red squares represent 1.\n- Blue squares represent 0.\n- The starting pattern in the top-left corner is:\n  ```\n  [Red (1), Blue (0)]\n  [Blue (0), Red (1)]\n  ```\n\nUsing this information, let's analyze each option.\n\n### Option A:\n```\n1 1 0 1 0 0\n1 1 0 0 1 0\n0 0 1 0 1 1\n0 1 0 1 0 1\n1 0 1 0 1 0\n0 0 1 1 0 1\n```\nDecisive fact: In the first row, there are three consecutive 0s (`...0 0 0...`). This violates Rule 2.\n\n### Option B:\n```\n0 1 0 1 0 0\n1 1 0 0 1 0\n0 0 1 0 1 1\n0 1 0 1 0 1\n1 0 1 0 1 0\n0 0 1 1 0 1\n```\nDecisive fact: The first column contains all zeros (`0 0 0 0 1 0`). This violates Rule 3 (unequal number of 0s and 1s).\n\n### Option C:\n```\n1 1 0 1 0 0\n1 1 0 0 1 0\n0 0 1 0 1 1\n0 1 0 0 0 1\n1 0 1 0 1 0\n0 0 1 1 0 1\n```\nDecisive fact: The fourth column contains three consecutive 0s (`...0 0 0...`). This violates Rule 2.\n\n### Option D:\n```\n1 1 0 1 0 0\n1 1 0 0 1 0\n0 0 1 0 1 1\n0 1 0 1 0 1\n1 0 1 0 1 0\n0 0 1 1 0 0\n```\nLet's verify:\n- No consecutive triplets of 0s or 1s in any row or column. ✔️\n- Each row and column has equal 0s and 1s. ✔️\n- No duplicate rows or columns. ✔️\n\nAll conditions are met.
