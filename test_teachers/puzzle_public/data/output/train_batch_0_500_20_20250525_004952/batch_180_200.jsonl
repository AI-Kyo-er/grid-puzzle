{"question_id": "binairo_522", "response": "Let's solve the given Binairo puzzle using the rules and the provided options.\n\n### Restating the Puzzle and Rules:\n\nWe have a 4x4 Binairo puzzle where:\n- Red squares represent '1'\n- Blue squares represent '0'\n\nThe rules are:\n1. Each cell contains either a 0 or 1.\n2. No more than two consecutive identical numbers in any row or column.\n3. Each row and column has an equal number of 0s and 1s.\n4. No two rows or columns are identical.\n\n\n### Key Information from the Picture:\nLooking at the image, we see filled cells:\n- The top-left corner is red ('1').\n- The second cell down in the first column is also red ('1').\n- The third cell across in the second row is red ('1').\n- The second cell across in the fourth row is blue ('0').\n\nThis gives us partial information:\n```\n1 _ _ _\n1 _ _ _\n_ _ 1 _\n_ 0 _ _\n```\n\n\n### Option Analysis:\n\n#### Option A:\n```\n1 1 0 0\n1 0 1 0\n0 1 0 1\n0 0 1 1\n```\n- Check row and column equality: ✓\n- Check for consecutive numbers: ✓\n- Check uniqueness of rows/columns: ✓\n- Check against given clues: Top-left is '1', second cell in first col is '1', middle cell in 2nd row is '1', second cell in bottom row is '0'.  ✓\n\n#### Option B:\n```\n0 1 0 0\n1 0 1 0\n0 1 0 1\n0 0 1 1\n```\n- **Decisive Fact:** The top-left corner is '0' but needs '1' based on the picture. ✗\n\n#### Option C:\n```\n1 1 0 0\n1 0 1 0\n0 1 1 1\n0 0 1 1\n```\n- **Decisive Fact:** Third row has three '1's violating rule of equal 0s and 1s. ✗\n\n#### Option D:\n```\n1 1 0 0\n1 0 1 0\n0 1 0 1\n0 0 1 0\n```\n- **Decisive Fact:** Bottom row ends with '0' instead of '1', violating clue where second cell should be '0'. ✗\n\n\n### Answer:\nOnly Option A matches all rules and given clues.\n\n\\boxed{A}", "ground_truth": "A", "prompt": "You need to solve a Binairo puzzle (Size: 4x4).\nYou need to solve a Binairo puzzle.\n\n**Binairo Puzzle Rules:**\n1.
