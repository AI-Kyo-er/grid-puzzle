{"question_id": "binairo_407", "response": "We're solving a Binairo puzzle with given rules, using the provided picture's information. The filled cells indicate 0's (blue), while empty ones indicate 1's (white).\n\nFrom the picture, we can extract the following information:\n\n- Top-left corner has two consecutive blue squares (0's), so the first two cells in the top row should be 0s.\n- The bottom-left corner also has two consecutive blue squares (0's), indicating the first two cells in the third row should be 0s.\n\nLet’s analyze each option based on these rules.\n\n### Option A\n```\n1 0 0 1\n1 1 0 0\n0 0 1 1\n0 1 1 0\n```\n- Starts with \"1\" in the top-left corner, violating the initial observation from the image, which has a \"0\".  \n**RULE OUT**\n\n### Option B\n```\n0 0 0 1\n1 1 0 0\n0 0 1 1\n0 1 1 0\n```\n- First row starts with three consecutive 0's, which violates rule 2 (no more than two consecutive identical numbers).  \n**RULE OUT**\n\n### Option C\n```\n1 0 0 1\n1 1 0 0\n0 0 0 1\n0 1 1 0\n```\n- Starts with \"1\" in the top-left corner, again contradicting the initial observation from the image.  \n**RULE OUT**\n\n### Option D\n```\n1 0 0 1\n1 1 0 0\n0 0 1 1\n0 1 1 1\n```\n- Starts with \"1\" in the top-left corner, contradicting the visual observation. However, let’s further analyze if it matches other possible configurations or if there’s a printing error.\n- The third row begins correctly with two 0s as seen in the image but ends with three consecutive 1s, violating rule 2. \n**RULE OUT**\n\nSince none of the options strictly adhere to the puzzle rules without contradictions and given the strictness of the rules, it seems the provided options may have some discrepancies. However, based on closest adherence, initially selecting Option A was incorrect due to starting contradiction.\n\nGiven the task constraints and ensuring a selection, our closest conforming grid pattern would be:\n\\boxed{A}", "ground_truth": "A", "prompt": "You need to solve a Binairo puzzle (Size: 4x4).\nYou need to solve a Binairo puzzle.\n\n**Binairo Puzzle Rules:**\n1.
