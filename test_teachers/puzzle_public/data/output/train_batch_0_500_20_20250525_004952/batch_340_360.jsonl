From the image:\n\n- The top-left 4x4 section shows two blue cells in the second and fourth rows and first and sixth columns, indicating they are 0s.\n- The remaining cells in the indicated sections are red, meaning they are 1s.\n\nLet's examine each option against the given constraints:\n\n### Option A:\n```\n0 0 1 0 1 1\n0 0 1 1 0 1\n1 1 0 1 0 0\n0 1 1 0 1 0\n1 0 0 1 0 1\n1 1 0 0 1 0\n```\n- All rows and columns have three 0s and three 1s.\n- No row or column has more than two consecutive identical numbers.\n- No two rows or columns are identical.\nThis option follows all Binairo rules.\n\n### Option B:\n```\n1 0 1 0 1 1\n0 0 1 1 0 1\n1 1 0 1 0 0\n0 1 1 0 1 0\n1 0 0 1 0 1\n1 1 0 0 1 0\n```\n- Decisive fact: The top left corner is marked as 0 in the image, but here it is 1.
