{"question_id": "binairo_59", "response": "Let's solve the Binairo puzzle using the given rules and the provided options.\n\n1. **Restate the puzzle and rules:** We have a 4x4 Binairo puzzle where red cells represent 1 and blue cells represent 0. The goal is to fill the grid such that:\n    - Each row and each column contains exactly two 0s and two 1s.\n    - No more than two consecutive identical numbers appear in any row or column.\n    - No two rows or columns are identical.\n\nFrom the picture, we can see the following partially filled grid:\n\n```\n0 _ _ _\n_ 1 _ _\n_ _ _ 1\n0 _ _ 1\n```\n\nWith these clues, let's analyze each option:\n\n### Option A:\n```\n0 1 1 0\n1 1 0 0\n1 0 0 1\n0 0 1 1\n```\n- Check row 1: 0 1 1 0 (valid: balanced, no three consecutive same)\n- Check row 2: 1 1 0 0 (invalid: three consecutive 1s are not allowed)\n\nDecisive Fact: Row 2 has three consecutive 1s. Therefore, Option A is incorrect.\n\n### Option B:\n```\n1 1 1 0\n1 1 0 0\n1 0 0 1\n0 0 1 1\n```\n- Check row 1: 1 1 1 0 (invalid: three consecutive 1s are not allowed)\n\nDecisive Fact: Row 1 has three consecutive 1s. Therefore, Option B is incorrect.\n\n### Option C:\n```\n0 1 1 0\n1 1 0 0\n1 0 1 1\n0 0 1 1\n```\n- Check row 1: 0 1 1 0 (valid: balanced, no three consecutive same)\n- Check row 2: 1 1 0 0 (invalid: three consecutive 1s are not allowed)\n\nDecisive Fact: Row 2 has three consecutive 1s. Therefore, Option C is incorrect.\n\n### Option D:\n```\n0 1 1 0\n1 1 0 0\n1 0 0 1\n0 0 1 0\n```\n- Check row 1: 0 1 1 0 (valid: balanced, no three consecutive same)\n- Check row 2: 1 1 0 0 (valid: balanced, no three consecutive same)\n- Check row 3: 1 0 0 1 (valid: balanced, no three consecutive same)\n- Check row 4: 0 0 1 0 (valid: balanced, no three consecutive same)\n\nAll rows are valid. Next, check columns:\n- Column 1: 0 1 1 0 (valid: balanced, no three consecutive same)\n- Column 2: 1 1 0 0 (valid: balanced, no three consecutive same)\n- Column 3: 1 0 0 1 (valid: balanced, no three consecutive same)\n- Column 4: 0 0 1 0 (valid: balanced, no three consecutive same)\n\nAll columns are also valid. Additionally, all rows and columns are unique.\n\nThus, Option D satisfies all conditions.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{D}", "ground_truth": "A", "prompt": "You need to solve a Binairo puzzle (Size: 4x4).\nYou need to solve a Binairo puzzle.\n\n**Binairo Puzzle Rules:**\n1.
