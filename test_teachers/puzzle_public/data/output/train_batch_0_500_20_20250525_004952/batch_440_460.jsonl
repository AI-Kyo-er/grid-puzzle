No more than two consecutive digits in a row or column.\n3. Each row/column contains three 0's and three 1's.\n4. Rows and columns are unique.\n\nFrom the image, blue cells represent 0's and red cells represent 1's. We'll use this information to validate the given options.\n\n---\n\n### Reasoning Based on Provided Information\n\nFrom the image, we observe the following filled cells:\n\n- Row 1: Blue in column 2 and column 5 => `...0..0...`\n- Row 2: Blue in column 2 and Red in column 3 => `...01...`\n- Row 4: Blue in column 5 => `.....0..`\n- Row 5: Blue in column 4 and Blue in column 6 => `......00`\n- Row 6: Blue in column 5 => `.....0..`\n\nThese observations will help in eliminating the wrong options.\n\n---\n\n### Option Analysis\n\n#### Option A:\n```\n1 0 0 1 0 1\n0 0 1 1 0 1\n0 1 1 0 1 0\n1 1 0 1 0 0\n0 0 1 0 1 1\n1 1 0 0 1 0\n```\n\n- No violations based on the rules and filled cells match observed values.

{"question_id": "binairo_1181", "response": "Let's solve the Binairo puzzle based on the given information:\n\n### Restating the Puzzle and Its Rules:\nWe're dealing with a 4x4 Binairo puzzle. The rules dictate that each row and column must have two 0s and two 1s, no more than two identical numbers consecutively, and no identical rows or columns.\n\n### Key Information Extracted From the Picture:\nFrom the image, we observe:\n- The top row: `[ , 1, 0, ]` (from red and blue squares)\n- The third row: `[ , 1, , 1]` (from red squares)\n- The fourth row: `[ , , , 0]` (from blue square)\n\nWith these clues, let's analyze the options:\n\n---\n\n#### Option Analysis:\n\n**Option A:**\n```plaintext\n1 1 0 0\n0 0 1 1\n0 1 0 1\n1 0 1 0\n```\n\n- **Check the Top Row:** Matches `[1, 1, 0, 0]` observed from the image. ✔️\n- **Check the Third Row:** Matches `[0, 1, 0, 1]` observed from the image. ✔️\n- **Check the Fourth Row:** Matches `[1, 0, 1, 0]` and fits the blue square at the bottom-right corner. ✔️\n\nAll observations align with the image, and Option A satisfies all Binairo rules.\n\n**Option B:**\n```plaintext\n0 1 0 0\n0 0 1 1\n0 1 0 1\n1 0 1 0\n```\n\n- **Check the Top Row:** `[0, 1, 0, 0]` contradicts observed `[ , 1, 0, ]`. ❌\n- Decisive Fact: Top row does not match observation.\n\n**Option C:**\n```plaintext\n1 1 0 0\n0 0 1 1\n0 1 1 1\n1 0 1 0\n```\n\n- **Check the Third Row:** `[0, 1, 1, 1]` has three consecutive 1s violating the rule. ❌\n- Decisive Fact: Third row contains three consecutive 1s.\n\n**Option D:**\n```plaintext\n1 1 0 0\n0 0 1 1\n0 1 0 1\n1 0 1 1\n```\n\n- **Check the Fourth Row:** `[1, 0, 1, 1]` violates the rule with three 1s in total. ❌\n- Decisive Fact: Fourth row has three 1s.\n\n---\n\n#### Final Answer:\nOnly Option A satisfies all conditions and aligns perfectly with the provided image.\n\n\\boxed{A}", "ground_truth": "A", "prompt": "You need to solve a Binairo puzzle (Size: 4x4).\nYou need to solve a Binairo puzzle.\n\n**Binairo Puzzle Rules:**\n1.
