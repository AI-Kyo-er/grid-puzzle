Each cell contains either a 0 or a 1.\n2. No more than two consecutive identical numbers in any row or column.\n3. Each row and column should have an equal number of 0s and 1s (three of each).\n4. No two rows or columns are identical.\n\nFrom the image, we observe the initial configuration:\n- Row 1: ...11...\n- Row 2: ...0...\n- Row 3: ...1...\n- Row 4: ...000...\n- Row 5: ...1...\n- Row 6: ...0...\n\n### Option Analysis:\n\n#### Option A:\n```\n0 0 1 1 0 1\n0 1 1 0 0 1\n1 0 0 1 1 0\n1 0 1 1 0 0\n0 1 0 0 1 1\n1 1 0 0 1 0\n```\n- Row 4 has three consecutive '1's, violating rule 2. \nThus, Option A is ruled out.\n\n#### Option B:\n```\n1 0 1 1 0 1\n0 1 1 0 0 1\n1 0 0 1 1 0\n1 0 1 1 0 0\n0 1 0 0 1 1\n1 1 0 0 1 0\n```\n- Row 1 starts with \"1\", mismatches the observed red square at position (1,1).\nThus, Option B is ruled out.\n\n#### Option C:\n```\n0 0 1 1 0 1\n0 1 1 0 0 1\n1 0 0 1 1 0\n1 0 1 0 0 0\n0 1 0 0 1 1\n1 1 0 0 1 0\n```\n- Row 4 has three '0's, violating rule 3. Also, contains two consecutive '0's in violation of rule 2.\nThus, Option C is ruled out.\n\n#### Option D:\n```\n0 0 1 1 0 1\n0 1 1 0 0 1\n1 0 0 1 1 0\n1 0 1 1 0 0\n0 1 0 0 1 1\n1 1 0 0 1 1\n```\n- After careful inspection, it meets all the rules:\n  - No more than two consecutive identical numbers.\n  - Equal count of 0s and 1s per row and column.\n  - All rows and columns are unique.\n\n### Final Answer:\nSince all other options violate at least one rule, and Option D adheres to all rules, the correct answer is: \\boxed{D}", "ground_truth": "A", "prompt": "You need to solve a Binairo puzzle (Size: 6x6).\nYou need to solve a Binairo puzzle.\n\n**Binairo Puzzle Rules:**\n1.
