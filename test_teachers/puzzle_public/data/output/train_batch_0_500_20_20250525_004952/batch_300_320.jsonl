{"question_id": "binairo_780", "response": "Let's solve the Binairo puzzle using the given rules and the provided options.\n\n### Restating the Puzzle and Rules:\n\nWe're solving a 4x4 Binairo puzzle. The rules are:\n1. Each cell contains either a 0 or a 1.\n2. No more than two consecutive identical numbers in any row or column.\n3. Each row and column has an equal number of 0s and 1s.\n4. No two rows or columns are identical.\n\nFrom the image, we observe:\n- Bottom-left cells have a pattern of blue (0) and red (1), matching Option A's bottom-left corner.\n\n### Option Analysis:\n\n#### Option A:\n```\n0 0 1 1\n1 0 0 1\n1 1 0 0\n0 1 1 0\n```\n- Each row and column has two 0s and two 1s.\n- No three consecutive identical numbers in any row or column.\n- All rows and columns are unique.\n\nAll conditions are satisfied. Let's continue checking other options for comparison.\n\n#### Option B:\n```\n1 0 1 1\n1 0 0 1\n1 1 0 0\n0 1 1 0\n```\n- Decisive Fact: First column has three 1s, violating rule 3.\n\n#### Option C:\n```\n0 0 1 1\n1 0 0 1\n1 1 1 0\n0 1 1 0\n```\n- Decisive Fact: Third row has three 1s, violating rule 3.\n\n#### Option D:\n```\n0 0 1 1\n1 0 0 1\n1 1 0 0\n0 1 1 1\n```\n- Decisive Fact: Fourth row has three 1s, violating rule 3.\n\n### Final Answer:\nSince only Option A satisfies all Binairo rules, the correct grid configuration is \\boxed{A}.", "ground_truth": "A", "prompt": "You need to solve a Binairo puzzle (Size: 4x4).\nYou need to solve a Binairo puzzle.\n\n**Binairo Puzzle Rules:**\n1.  Each cell must contain either a 0 or a 1.\n2.  There can be no more than two consecutive identical numbers in any row or column (e.g., 000 or 111 are not allowed).\n3.  Each row and each column must contain an equal number of 0s and 1s.\n4.  No two rows can be identical, and no two columns can be identical.\n\nThe red represent 1 and the blue represent 0.\n\nYour task is to choose the correct grid configuration from the options below that represents the solution to the puzzle.
