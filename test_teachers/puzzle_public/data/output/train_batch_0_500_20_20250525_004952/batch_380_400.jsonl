The rules include:\n1. Each cell contains either 0 or 1.\n2. No more than two consecutive identical numbers in any row/column.\n3. Equal numbers of 0s and 1s per row/column.\n4. No two rows or columns are identical.\n\n\n### Key Information Extracted From the Picture:\nFrom the image, we have:\n- Red cells (representing 1) are located at positions (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,2), (3,3), (5,1), and (6,6).\n- Blue cells (representing 0) are located at positions (1,4), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,4), (4,1), (4,5), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (6,1), (6,3), (6,4), and (6,5).\n\nUsing this information, let's analyze each option.\n\n---\n\n### Option Analysis\n\n#### Option A:\n```\n0 0 1 1 0 1    ✓ matches the picture\n1 1 0 1 0 0    ✓ matches the picture\n1 1 0 0 1 0    ✓ matches the picture\n0 0 1 0 1 1    ✓ matches the picture and follows rules\n0 1 0 1 0 1    ✓ follows rules\n1 0 1 0 1 0    ✓ follows rules\n```\n- All rows and columns follow the rules and do not contradict the given color positions.

{"question_id": "binairo_371", "response": "To solve this Binairo puzzle, let's proceed based on the given constraints and the visual representation:\n\n### Restating the Puzzle & Rules:\nThis is a 4x4 Binairo puzzle where red cells represent 1 and blue cells represent 0. Each row and column must contain an equal number of 0s and 1s, avoid more than two consecutive identical digits, and ensure unique configurations for all rows and columns.\n\n### Key Information from the Picture:\nFrom the picture:\n- The top-right cell contains a 1 (red).\n- The second row has a sequence \"10\" starting from the left.\n- The third row starts with a 0 (blue), followed by a 1 (red), then another 1 (red) at the end.\n- The fourth row starts with a 1 (red) and ends with a 0 (blue).\n\n### Option Analysis:\n#### Option A:\n```\n0 1 0 1\n1 0 0 1\n0 1 1 0\n1 0 1 0\n```\n- Checks out for each rule, matching the picture clues perfectly.

Therefore, C is incorrect.\n\n#### Option D:\n```\n0 1 0 1\n1 0 0 1\n0 1 1 0\n1 0 1 1\n```\n- Decisive Fact: The third row matches but the last row contains three consecutive 1s (\"11\"), breaking the rule.

{"question_id": "binairo_719", "response": "This is a Binairo puzzle with a 6x6 grid. The red cells represent \"1\" and the blue cells represent \"0\". Let's proceed:\n\n### From the Picture:\n- The first row contains the pattern \"0 _ _ 1 _ _\".\n- The second row contains the pattern \"_ 1 _ _ _ _\".\n- The third row contains the pattern \"_ _ _ 0 _ _\".\n- The fourth row contains the pattern \"_ 0 _ 0 _ _\".\n- The fifth row contains the pattern \"_ 0 _ 0 _ _\".\n- The sixth row contains the pattern \"_ _ _ _ 1 _\".\n\nThese patterns will help us rule out options later on.\n\n### Option Analysis:\n\n#### Option A:\n```\n0 1 0 1 1 0\n1 1 0 0 1 0\n1 0 1 0 0 1\n0 1 0 1 0 1\n1 0 1 0 1 0\n0 0 1 1 0 1\n```\n- Check: Rows and columns have correct counts and patterns. This seems valid.\n\n#### Option B:\n```\n1 1 0 1 1 0\n1 1 0 0 1 0\n1 0 1 0 0 1\n0 1 0 1 0 1\n1 0 1 0 1 0\n0 0 1 1 0 1\n```\n- Decisive fact: The first row violates the \"no more than two consecutive numbers\" rule with three '1's (\"1 1 0 1 1 0\"). Thus B is incorrect.\n\n#### Option C:\n```\n0 1 0 1 1 0\n1 1 0 0 1 0\n1 0 1 0 0 1\n0 1 0 0 0 1\n1 0 1 0 1 0\n0 0 1 1 0 1\n```\n- Decisive fact: The fourth row has three consecutive '0's (\"0 1 0 0 0 1\"), violating the rule. Thus C is incorrect.\n\n#### Option D:\n```\n0 1 0 1 1 0\n1 1 0 0 1 0\n1 0 1 0 0 1\n0 1 0 1 0 1\n1 0 1 0 1 0\n0 0 1 1 0 0\n```\n- Decisive fact: The last row ends with two '0's but should end with a '1' based on the pattern seen in the picture. Also, it doesn’t match the requirement of having an equal count of 0s and 1s. Thus D is incorrect.\n\n### Answer:\nSince Options B, C, and D all violate the puzzle rules based on the given information, we are left with Option A as the only possible correct solution.\n\n\\boxed{A}", "ground_truth": "A", "prompt": "You need to solve a Binairo puzzle (Size: 6x6).\nYou need to solve a Binairo puzzle.\n\n**Binairo Puzzle Rules:**\n1.  Each cell must contain either a 0 or a 1.\n2.  There can be no more than two consecutive identical numbers in any row or column (e.g., 000 or 111 are not allowed).\n3.  Each row and each column must contain an equal number of 0s and 1s.\n4.  No two rows can be identical, and no two columns can be identical.\n\nThe red represent 1 and the blue represent 0.\n\nYour task is to choose the correct grid configuration from the options below that represents the solution to the puzzle. Each cell is represented by 0 or 1.\n\nOption A:\n```\n0 1 0 1 1 0\n1 1 0 0 1 0\n1 0 1 0 0 1\n0 1 0 1 0 1\n1 0 1 0 1 0\n0 0 1 1 0 1\n```\n\nOption B:\n```\n1 1 0 1 1 0\n1 1 0 0 1 0\n1 0 1 0 0 1\n0 1 0 1 0 1\n1 0 1 0 1 0\n0 0 1 1 0 1\n```\n\nOption C:\n```\n0 1 0 1 1 0\n1 1 0 0 1 0\n1 0 1 0 0 1\n0 1 0 0 0 1\n1 0 1 0 1 0\n0 0 1 1 0 1\n```\n\nOption D:\n```\n0 1 0 1 1 0\n1 1 0 0 1 0\n1 0 1 0 0 1\n0 1 0 1 0 1\n1 0 1 0 1 0\n0 0 1 1 0 0\n```\n\nPlease provide your answer as a single letter (A, B, C, or D) in \\boxed{} corresponding to the correct option.\nnPlease check carefully about each option and show your checking process.
