{"question_id": "binairo_657", "response": "We are solving a Binairo puzzle (4x4) following the specified rules. From the given image:\n\n- Red squares indicate '1'.\n- White squares indicate '0'.\n\nThis translates to the initial state of the puzzle as:\n\n```\n1 1 _ _\n1 _ _ _\n_ _ _ _\n_ 1 _ 1\n```\n\nLet's analyze each option based on this information and the Binairo rules.\n\n\n### Option A:\n```\n1 1 0 0\n1 0 1 0\n0 0 1 1\n0 1 0 1\n```\n- It maintains two 1s at the top-left corner.\n- The second row starts with '1' followed by '0'.\n- Each row and column has an equal number of 0s and 1s, no three consecutive identical digits, and no duplicate rows/columns.\n- **This matches our initial state completely.**\n\n\n### Option B:\n```\n0 1 0 0\n1 0 1 0\n0 0 1 1\n0 1 0 1\n```\n- **Decisive Fact:** The first row starts with '0', contradicting the given initial state, which starts with '11'.\n\n### Option C:\n```\n1 1 0 0\n1 0 1 0\n0 0 0 1\n0 1 0 1\n```\n- **Decisive Fact:** The third row contains '000', violating the rule against three consecutive identical digits.\n\n### Option D:\n```\n1 1 0 0\n1 0 1 0\n0 0 1 1\n0 1 0 0\n```\n- **Decisive Fact:** The fourth row ends with '00', violating the rule against three consecutive identical digits when combined with the previous '0'.\n\n\nAfter analyzing all options, only Option A satisfies all the puzzle conditions and matches the initial state provided.\n\nThus, the correct answer is \\boxed{A}.", "ground_truth": "A", "prompt": "You need to solve a Binairo puzzle (Size: 4x4).\nYou need to solve a Binairo puzzle.\n\n**Binairo Puzzle Rules:**\n1.
