The red squares indicate 1s and the blue squares indicate 0s from the image.

{"question_id": "binairo_236", "response": "Let's solve this 4x4 Binairo puzzle using the provided rules while examining the given color-coded cells as starting points:\n\n### Restating the puzzle and its rules\nWe have a 4x4 grid where each cell contains either a '0' (blue) or a '1' (red). The puzzle rules are:\n- No more than two consecutive numbers in any row/column.\n- Equal numbers of 0s and 1s in each row/column.\n- No two rows/columns should be identical.\n\n\n### Extracting Key Information\n\nFrom the picture:\n- Top-left corner (cell 1,1): Red (1)\n- Top-right second cell (cell 1,2): Red (1)\n- Third row, third column (cell 3,3): Blue (0)\n- Fourth row, second column (cell 4,2): Red (1)\n\nNow let's analyze the options keeping these values and the rules in mind.\n\n---\n\n### Option Analysis\n\n#### Option A:\n```\n1 1 0 0\n1 0 0 1\n0 0 1 1\n0 1 1 0\n```\n- It matches the required colored cells from the picture.\n- No three consecutive numbers appear.\n- Rows and columns have 2 '0's and 2 '1's each.\n- Rows and columns are unique.\n\nEverything checks out under all rules.\n\n#### Option B:\n```\n0 1 0 0\n1 0 0 1\n0 0 1 1\n0 1 1 0\n```\n- Decisive fact: Cell (1,1) is '0', but the picture shows it should be '1'. Thus, it's incorrect.\n\n#### Option C:\n```\n1 1 0 0\n1 0 0 1\n0 0 0 1\n0 1 1 0\n```\n- Decisive fact: Cell (3,3) is '0', but there are three consecutive '0's in the third row, violating rule 2.\n\n#### Option D:\n```\n1 1 0 0\n1 0 0 1\n0 0 1 1\n0 1 1 1\n```\n- Decisive fact: Row 4 has three consecutive '1's, violating rule 2.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer\nOnly Option A satisfies all the conditions and rules.

{"question_id": "binairo_1378", "response": "We're solving a Binairo puzzle based on the given visual clues. The red cells indicate '1's. Let's re-examine these clues:\n\n- Row 2 has two red cells at positions (2,2) and (2,3), so those cells should be '1'.\n- Row 5 has one red cell at position (5,1), so that cell should be '1'.\n- Row 6 has two red cells at positions (6,1) and (6,2), so those cells should be '1'.\n- Column 4 has two red cells at positions (4,4) and (5,4), so those cells should be '1'.\n- Column 5 has one red cell at position (3,5), so that cell should be '1'.\n- Column 6 has one red cell at position (3,6), so that cell should be '1'.\n\nNow, let’s analyze each option against these clues:\n\n### Option A:\n```\n1 0 1 0 0 1\n0 1 1 0 1 0\n1 0 0 1 0 1\n0 0 1 0 1 1\n0 1 0 1 1 0\n1 1 0 1 0 0\n```\n- It matches the positions of the red cells (1s) we identified. However, the last column has three zeros, violating Rule 3 (equal distribution of 0s and 1s in each row/column). Thus, this option is incorrect.\n\n### Option B:\n```\n0 0 1 0 0 1\n0 1 1 0 1 0\n1 0 0 1 0 1\n0 0 1 0 1 1\n0 1 0 1 1 0\n1 1 0 1 0 0\n```\n- This option fails immediately because it violates the visual clue: the first cell of the second row is marked red, but this grid shows a '0' there. Thus, this option is incorrect.\n\n### Option C:\n```\n1 0 1 0 0 1\n0 1 1 0 1 0\n1 0 0 1 0 1\n0 0 1 1 1 1\n0 1 0 1 1 0\n1 1 0 1 0 0\n```\n- This option also fails the visual clue: the fourth row contains three consecutive '1's, violating Rule 2 (no more than two consecutive identical numbers in a row/column). Thus, this option is incorrect.\n\n### Option D:\n```\n1 0 1 0 0 1\n0 1 1 0 1 0\n1 0 0 1 0 1\n0 0 1 0 1 1\n0 1 0 1 1 0\n1 1 0 1 0 1\n```\n- This option matches all the visual clues (positions of red cells) and satisfies all Binairo rules. Each row and column has an equal number of 0s and 1s, and no more than two consecutive identical numbers appear anywhere.\n\nThus, the correct answer is \\boxed{D}.", "ground_truth": "A", "prompt": "You need to solve a Binairo puzzle (Size: 6x6).\nYou need to solve a Binairo puzzle.\n\n**Binairo Puzzle Rules:**\n1.
