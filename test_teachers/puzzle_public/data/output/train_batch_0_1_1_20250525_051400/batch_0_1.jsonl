{"question_id": "aquarium_622", "response": "To determine the correct solution for the Aquarium puzzle, let's carefully analyze the given constraints and conditions:\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1. **Grid Structure and Tanks:**\n   - The grid is divided into two tanks by the red lines.\n   - The larger tank spans the entire grid except for the smaller central square tank.\n   - The smaller tank consists of only the central 2x2 square.\n\n2. **Clue Numbers:**\n   - Row clues (left side): [0, 0, 2, 2]\n   - Column clues (top side): [0, 0, 2, 2]\n\n3. **Applying Clues:**\n\n   - **Row Analysis:**\n     - The first two rows have a clue of '0', meaning no cells in these rows should contain water.\n     - The last two rows have a clue of '2', meaning there should be 2 cells filled with water in each of these rows.\n\n   - **Column Analysis:**\n     - The first two columns have a clue of '0', meaning no cells in these columns should contain water.\n     - The last two columns have a clue of '2', meaning there should be 2 cells filled with water in each of these columns.\n\n4. **Water Level Rule:**\n   - In the larger tank, water must fill uniformly down to the bottom if any cell is filled.\n   - In the smaller central tank, the same rule applies but only within the 2x2 square.\n\n### Verifying Options:\n\n- **Option A:**\n  ```\n  0 0 0 0\n  0 0 0 1\n  0 0 1 1\n  0 0 1 1\n  ```\n  - Rows: Satisfies row clues but does not follow the water level rule (water doesn't settle uniformly in the central tank).\n\n- **Option B:**\n  ```\n  0 0 0 0\n  0 0 0 0\n  0 0 1 1\n  0 0 1 1\n  ```\n  - Rows: Satisfies row clues.\n  - Columns: Satisfies column clues.\n  - Water Level: Follows the water level rule in both tanks.\n\n- **Option C:**\n  ```\n  0 0 0 0\n  0 0 0 0\n  0 0 1 1\n  0 0 0 1\n  ```\n  - Rows: Does not satisfy row clues (last row has only one cell filled instead of two).\n\n- **Option D:**\n  ```\n  0 1 0 0\n  0 0 0 0\n  0 0 1 1\n  1 0 1 1\n  ```\n  - Rows: Does not satisfy any row clues correctly and does not follow water level rules.\n\nAfter careful analysis, Option B is the only one that satisfies all the constraints and rules of the puzzle.\n\nThus, the correct answer is \\boxed{B}.", "ground_truth": "B", "prompt": "You need to solve an Aquarium puzzle.\n\n**Aquarium Puzzle Rules:**\n1.  **The Grid:** The grid is divided into several regions called \"tanks\" by the thick colored (red) lines.\n2.  **The Goal:** Your goal is to fill some cells in the grid with \"water\".\n3.  **Water Levels:** Within each tank, water must settle at a uniform level. This means: if a cell is filled with water, all cells directly below it *within the same tank* must also be filled, down to the bottom of that tank.\n4.  **Clues:** The numbers outside the grid indicate how many cells *in total* must be filled with water in that specific row (numbers on the left) or column (numbers on the top).\n5.  **Solving:** Use the numbers as clues to figure out which cells must be filled with water, ensuring that the water level rule within each tank is followed, until all numbers are satisfied.\n\n\nYour task is to choose the correct grid configuration from the options below that represents the solution to the puzzle. Each cell is represented by 0 (empty) or 1 (water).\n\nOption A:\n```\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 1\n0 0 1 1\n0 0 1 1\n```\n\nOption B:\n```\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 1\n0 0 1 1\n```\n\nOption C:\n```\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 1\n0 0 0 1\n```\n\nOption D:\n```\n0 1 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 1\n1 0 1 1\n```\n\nPlease provide your answer as a single letter (A, B, C, or D) in \\boxed{} corresponding to the correct option.\nLet's think step by step:\n\n                                1. First, analyze the puzzle type and understand the rules.\n\n                                2. Examine the given constraints and initial conditions.\n\n                                3. Apply logical reasoning to solve the puzzle.\n\n                                4. Verify your solution against all rules.\n\n                                5.
