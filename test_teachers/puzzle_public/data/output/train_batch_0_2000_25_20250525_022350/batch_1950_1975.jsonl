Therefore, Option A is invalid.\n- **Decisive Fact:** The fourth row has duplicate '4's.\n\n### Option B\nIn the first row, we observe two '5's. This also violates the rule that each digit should appear only once per row.

However, the water does not settle uniformly in the first tank of this row (the entire tank should have been filled based on the water presence on the third cell). \n    - **Decisive Fact:** Does not satisfy uniform water level in tanks.\n\n#### Option B:\n```\n0 0 0 1 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 1\n0 0 1 0 1\n0 0 1 1 1\n```\n- Row 3 has only two water cells but does not satisfy the uniform water rule within the second tank of this row (the entire tank should have been filled based on the water presence on the third cell).\n    - **Decisive Fact:** Does not satisfy uniform water level in tanks.\n\n#### Option C:\n```\n0 0 0 1 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 1\n0 0 1 1 1\n0 0 1 0 1\n```\n- Row 3 has three water cells but does not satisfy the uniform water rule within the second tank of this row (the entire tank should have been filled based on the water presence on the fourth and fifth cells).\n    - **Decisive Fact:** Does not satisfy uniform water level in tanks.\n\n#### Option D:\n```\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 1\n0 0 1 1 1\n0 0 1 1 1\n```\n- All rows match their respective water counts.\n- Water settles uniformly in tanks within each row and column following the puzzle's rules.\n- Column counts also align perfectly with the given values.\n\n---\n\nThus, Option D satisfies all the rules and constraints of the Aquarium puzzle.\n\n\\boxed{D}", "ground_truth": "D", "prompt": "You need to solve an Aquarium puzzle (Size: 5x5).\nRow water counts: [0, 0, 2, 3, 3]\nColumn water counts: [0, 0, 3, 2, 3]\nTank compartments: [[1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [5, 1, 1, 1, 1], [5, 1, 2, 1, 7], [5, 5, 3, 4, 7], [5, 5, 6, 7, 7]]\nYou need to solve an Aquarium puzzle.\n\n**Aquarium Puzzle Rules:**\n1.  **The Grid:** The grid is divided into several regions called \"tanks\" by the thick colored (red) lines.\n2.  **The Goal:** Your goal is to fill some cells in the grid with \"water\".\n3.  **Water Levels:** Within each tank, water must settle at a uniform level. This means: if a cell is filled with water, all cells directly below it *within the same tank* must also be filled, down to the bottom of that tank.\n4.  **Clues:** The numbers outside the grid indicate how many cells *in total* must be filled with water in that specific row (numbers on the left) or column (numbers on the top).\n5.  **Solving:** Use the numbers as clues to figure out which cells must be filled with water, ensuring that the water level rule within each tank is followed, until all numbers are satisfied.\n\n\nYour task is to choose the correct grid configuration from the options below that represents the solution to the puzzle. Each cell is represented by 0 (empty) or 1 (water).\n\nOption A:\n```\n0 0 0 1 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 1\n1 0 1 1 1\n0 0 1 1 1\n```\n\nOption B:\n```\n0 0 0 1 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 1\n0 0 1 0 1\n0 0 1 1 1\n```\n\nOption C:\n```\n0 0 0 1 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 1\n0 0 1 1 1\n0 0 1 0 1\n```\n\nOption D:\n```\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 1\n0 0 1 1 1\n0 0 1 1 1\n```\n\nPlease provide your answer as a single letter (A, B, C, or D) in \\boxed{} corresponding to the correct option.\nnPlease check carefully about each option and show your checking process.
