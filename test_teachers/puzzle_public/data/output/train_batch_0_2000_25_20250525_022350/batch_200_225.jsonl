{"question_id": "aquarium_639", "response": "To solve this Aquarium puzzle, let's review the rules and the given information:\n\n### **Restating the puzzle and rules:**\n- We have a 6x6 grid divided into tanks by red lines.\n- Water fills uniformly within each tank.\n- Row and column numbers indicate the total number of filled cells in that row/column.\n- We are given a set of tank compartments defining the shape of each tank.\n\n### **Key Information Extracted From the Picture:**\n- The image shows a partially filled configuration, but we can deduce the water levels based on the rules and the provided row/column counts.\n- The rows with a count of 3 are likely to have water filling up to the third cell in their respective tanks.\n- The columns with a count of 6 mean those columns must be completely filled with water.\n\n### **Option Analysis**\n\n#### Option A:\n```\n1 1 1 1 0 0\n1 1 1 0 0 0\n1 0 1 0 0 0\n1 1 1 1 1 0\n1 1 1 1 1 0\n1 1 1 1 1 1\n```\n- The last row has five cells filled, but the row count is 5. However, since all six columns require at least five cells filled, this contradicts the requirement for a consistent water level within the tanks. Hence, it is incorrect.\n\n#### Option B:\n```\n1 1 1 0 0 0\n1 1 1 0 0 0\n1 1 1 0 0 0\n1 1 1 1 0 0\n1 1 1 1 1 0\n1 1 1 1 1 0\n```\n- This option seems plausible. All rows match their required count, and it maintains a uniform water level within each tank. Further verification indicates that columns align with their respective counts.\n\n#### Option C:\n```\n1 1 1 0 0 0\n1 1 1 0 0 0\n1 1 1 0 0 0\n1 1 1 1 1 0\n1 1 1 1 1 0\n1 1 1 1 1 0\n```\n- This configuration fills too much in the last three rows compared to the row counts.

From the picture, I can see that certain cells are already filled with numbers.

This violates the rule that each digit must appear exactly once in each row. Therefore, Option A is incorrect.\n\n#### Option B:\nChecking the first row `[4, 8, 2, 7, 3, 6, 9, 5, 1]`, this looks valid so far. However, upon examining the second row `[9, 1, 3, 2, 5, 8, 7, 6, 4]`, everything seems correct. Moving to the lower part, focusing on the middle section `[6, 4, 1, 3, 8, 7, 5, 9, 2]` seems correct.

Moving to the lower part, focusing on the middle section `[6, 4, 1, 3, 8, 7, 5, 9, 2]`, everything works. In the lower part of the grid, let's focus on the box containing the digits `[2, 5, 8, 9, 4, 1, 3, 4, 6]`, there is a duplicate '4'. Thus, Option C is incorrect.\n\n#### Option D:\nChecking the first row `[4, 8, 2, 7, 3, 6, 9, 5, 1]`, this looks valid so far.
