{"question_id": "aquarium_449", "response": "### Restating the Puzzle and Its Rules:\n\nWe're tackling an Aquarium puzzle, a 6x6 grid separated into tanks by red lines. The aim is to fill certain cells with \"water,\" adhering to the following rules:\n- Water settles uniformly within each tank.\n- Numbers outside the grid indicate the number of water cells per row/column.\n- We use these clues to determine the correct water configuration.\n\n### Extracted Information from the Picture:\n\nFrom the given image, we observe:\n- The row water counts are [3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4].\n- The column water counts are [6, 6, 6, 0, 2, 0].\n- The tanks are defined by the red lines.\n\nThis data provides critical guidance for filling the grid correctly.\n\n### Option Analysis:\n\nLet's examine each option:\n\n#### Option A:\n```\n1 1 1 0 0 0\n1 1 0 0 0 0\n1 1 1 0 0 0\n1 1 1 0 0 0\n1 1 1 0 1 0\n1 1 1 0 1 0\n```\nDecisive fact: Column 2 requires six water cells based on the column clue. However, Option A only has five water cells in column 2. Therefore, Option A is incorrect.\n\n#### Option B:\n```\n1 1 1 0 0 0\n1 1 1 0 0 0\n1 1 1 0 0 0\n1 1 1 0 0 0\n1 1 1 0 1 0\n1 1 1 0 1 0\n```\nDecisive fact: This option satisfies all row and column water count requirements while maintaining uniform water levels within each tank. It seems plausible and needs further verification against other options.\n\n#### Option C:\n```\n1 1 1 0 0 0\n1 1 0 0 0 0\n1 1 1 0 0 0\n1 1 1 0 1 1\n1 1 1 0 1 0\n1 1 1 0 1 0\n```\nDecisive fact: Row 4 should have 3 water cells according to the row clue.

Option D has multiple water cells in column 4, violating this rule. So, Option D is incorrect.\n\n### Final Answer:\nOnly Option B adheres strictly to all puzzle rules and constraints.

Water levels must be uniform within each tank, and the numbers outside the grid indicate the total number of water-filled cells per row/column.\n\n### 2. Key Information Extracted From the Picture:\n\n- Tank compartments are defined by red lines.\n- Row water counts: [0, 3, 5, 6, 6, 6].\n- Column water counts: [5, 5, 5, 4, 3, 4].\n\n### Option Analysis:\n\n#### **Option A:**\n```\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 1 1 0 0 0\n1 1 1 1 0 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 0 1 1\n```\n- **Column Check**: In the third column, there are 5 water cells but the count requires only 5, matching the clue. However, in the fourth column, the water count is 5 whereas the clue indicates only 4. Hence, this violates the puzzle's rules.\n- **Conclusion**: Option A is incorrect due to Column 4 having too much water.\n\n#### **Option B:**\n```\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 1 1 0 0 0\n1 1 1 1 0 1\n1 1 1 0 1 1\n1 1 0 1 1 1\n1 1 0 1 1 1\n```\n- **Column Check**: In the third column, the water count is 4 which contradicts the given column water count of 5. Thus, this violates the puzzle's rules.\n- **Conclusion**: Option B is incorrect due to Column 3 having insufficient water.\n\n#### **Option C:**\n```\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 1 0 1 0 0\n1 1 1 1 0 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1\n```\n- **Row Check**: The second row has 2 water cells instead of 3 as required by the row count. Hence, this violates the puzzle's rules.\n- **Conclusion**: Option C is incorrect due to Row 2 having insufficient water.\n\n#### **Option D:**\n```\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 1 1 0 0 0\n1 1 1 1 0 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1\n```\n- **Row Check**: All rows satisfy their respective counts.\n- **Column Check**: All columns satisfy their respective counts.\n- **Tank Check**: Water levels are uniform within each tank.\n- **Conclusion**: All conditions met.\n\n### Answer:\n\\boxed{D}", "ground_truth": "D", "prompt": "You need to solve an Aquarium puzzle (Size: 6x6).\nRow water counts: [0, 3, 5, 6, 6, 6]\nColumn water counts: [5, 5, 5, 4, 3, 4]\nTank compartments: [[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [5, 5, 5, 2, 1, 1], [5, 5, 5, 5, 1, 3], [5, 5, 5, 6, 4, 3], [5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8], [5, 5, 5, 6, 7, 8]]\nYou need to solve an Aquarium puzzle.\n\n**Aquarium Puzzle Rules:**\n1.  **The Grid:** The grid is divided into several regions called \"tanks\" by the thick colored (red) lines.\n2.  **The Goal:** Your goal is to fill some cells in the grid with \"water\".\n3.  **Water Levels:** Within each tank, water must settle at a uniform level.
