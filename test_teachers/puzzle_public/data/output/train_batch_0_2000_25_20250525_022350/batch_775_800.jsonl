This violates Sudoku's rule of having unique digits in each row.\n- **Decision:** Option A is incorrect because it violates the uniqueness constraint in a row.\n\n#### Option B:\n```\n2 5 7 9 3 8 4 6 1\n3 6 4 7 1 5 2 8 9\n9 3 1 6 4 2 6 7 5\n7 3 6 1 8 9 5 2 4\n1 4 9 2 5 6 8 3 7\n8 2 5 3 7 4 1 9 6\n6 1 2 9 9 3 7 5 8\n5 7 3 8 6 1 9 4 2\n4 9 8 5 2 7 6 1 3\n```\n- **Check for Validity:** \n  - The third row has two '6's, violating the Sudoku rule for rows.\n- **Decision:** Option B is incorrect due to duplicate digits in a row.\n\n#### Option C:\n```\n2 5 7 9 3 8 4 6 1\n3 6 4 7 1 5 2 8 9\n9 8 1 6 4 2 3 7 5\n7 3 6 1 8 9 5 2 4\n1 4 9 2 5 6 8 3 7\n8 2 5 3 7 4 1 9 6\n6 1 2 4 9 3 7 5 8\n5 7 3 8 6 1 9 4 2\n4 9 8 5 2 7 6 1 3\n```\n- **Check for Validity:**\n  - All rows, columns, and 3x3 subgrids seem to have unique digits from 1 to 9, satisfying Sudoku rules.\n- **Decision:** Option C passes initial checks.\n\n#### Option D:\n```\n2 5 7 9 3 8 4 6 1\n3 6 4 7 1 5 2 8 9\n9 8 1 6 4 2 8 7 5\n7 3 6 1 8 9 5 2 4\n1 4 9 2 5 6 8 3 7\n8 2 5 3 7 4 1 9 6\n6 1 2 4 9 3 7 5 8\n5 7 3 8 6 1 4 4 2\n4 9 8 5 2 7 6 1 3\n```\n- **Check for Validity:** \n  - The third row has two '8's, breaking Sudoku's uniqueness requirement for rows.\n  - The eighth row has two '4's, also invalidating Sudoku's rule.\n- **Decision:** Option D is incorrect due to multiple violations.\n\n### Final Answer:\nOnly Option C satisfies all the Sudoku rules.
