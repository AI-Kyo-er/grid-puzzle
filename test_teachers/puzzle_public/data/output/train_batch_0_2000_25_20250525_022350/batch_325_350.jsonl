{"question_id": "sudoku_85", "response": "We are solving a 9x9 Sudoku puzzle following the given rules. The image provides a partially filled Sudoku grid, and we're asked to identify the correctly completed grid among options A, B, C, and D.\n\nFirst, I'll analyze the given Sudoku puzzle image to extract key clues. Then, I will compare these clues with the options to determine the correct solution.\n\n### Key Clues from Image:\nFrom the given Sudoku grid, here are some critical clues visible:\n\n1. In the top-left 3x3 box:\n   - The first row is `[6, _, 3, _, _, 7, _, _, _]`. This means the first cell is '6', the third cell is '3', and the sixth cell is '7'.\n\n2. In the second row:\n   - The sequence is `[9, _, 8, 6, ?, 5, 4, ?, 1]`.\n\n3. In the seventh row:\n   - The first two cells contain `[4, 3]`.\n\n4. In the bottom-right 3x3 box:\n   - The last row contains `[_, _, 3, _, 1, _, 2, 8, _]`, indicating a '3' in the third cell and a '1' in the fifth cell of the row.\n\n\n### Option Analysis:\nLet's verify each option against the above clues:\n\n#### Option A:\n- Top-left 3x3 box: Matches the clues (`[6, _, 3, _, _, 7]`).\n- Second row: Matches the clue (`[9, _, 8, 6, _, 5, 4, _, 1]`).\n- Seventh row: Starts with `[4, 3]`; matches.\n- Bottom-right 3x3 box: Matches the clue (`[_, _, 3, _, 1, _, 2, 8, _]`).\n\nNo discrepancies; let’s proceed to the next option.\n\n#### Option B:\n- Top-left 3x3 box: Matches the clues (`[6, _, 3, _, _, 7]`).\n- Second row: Matches the clue (`[9, _, 8, 6, _, 5, 4, _, 1]`).\n- Seventh row: Starts with `[4, 3]`; matches.\n- Bottom-right 3x3 box: Matches the clue (`[_, _, 3, _, 1, _, 2, 8, _]`).\n\nNo discrepancies; let’s proceed to the next option.\n\n#### Option C:\n- Seventh row violates the rule since it has two '7's in the same row `[3, 8, 4, 7, 1, 6, 5, 7, 2]`.\n\nThis is a clear violation; thus, Option C can't be the correct answer.\n\n#### Option D:\n- Top-left 3x3 box: Third row shows `[8, 1, 5, 4, 5, 8, 6, 7, 9]`, violating the rule where '5' appears twice in this row.\n\nThis rules out Option D.\n\nSince both Options A and B match our extracted clues but not C and D, we must check further to ensure no other discrepancies exist.

{"question_id": "sudoku_193", "response": "Let's solve this Sudoku using the given rules and provided options.\n\n### Step 1: Restate the Puzzle and Rules\nWe're solving a 9x9 Sudoku. The puzzle follows these rules:\n- Each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid must contain the digits 1 through 9 exactly once.\n- The puzzle starts with some pre-filled cells, and we must fill the remaining cells while adhering to the above constraints.\n\n### Step 2: Extract Key Information from the Picture\nFrom the picture, the initial Sudoku grid has the following pre-filled cells:\n\n```plaintext\n+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+\n| 4 |   |   | 8 | 2 |   | 1 | 6 |   |\n|   |   |   |   | 4 | 5 |   | 3 |   |\n| 5 |   |   |   | 7 |   |   |   |   |\n|   |   | 4 | 5 |   | 9 |   |   | 1 |\n| 2 | 6 |   |   | 8 | 7 | 5 |   |   |\n|   |   | 8 | 2 |   | 3 |   |   | 4 |\n|   | 3 | 5 | 1 |   |   |   | 2 | 8 |\n| 8 |   | 9 |   | 2 |   | 3 |   |   |\n| 6 | 4 | 2 | 3 |   |   | 9 |   |   |\n+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+\n```\n\n### Step 3: Option Analysis\n\n#### Option A:\nExamining the first row: `2 9 7 8 3 2 1 6 5`\n- It contains two '2's. This violates the rule that each digit must appear exactly once per row.\n**Decisive Fact:** Invalid due to duplicate '2' in the first row.\n\n#### Option B:\nExamining the last column: `5 2 9 1 3 2 8 6 7`\n- It contains two '2's. This violates the rule that each digit must appear exactly once per column.\n**Decisive Fact:** Invalid due to duplicate '2' in the last column.\n\n#### Option C:\nExamining the last row: `6 4 2 3 5 8 9 1 7`\n- It contains an '8' and '9', but the original pre-filled value in the last row third column is '2'. The '2' is missing.\n**Decisive Fact:** Invalid because it does not match the pre-filled values and is missing necessary digits to satisfy the row constraint.\n\n#### Option D:\nExamining all rows, columns, and 3x3 subgrids:\n- All constraints are satisfied without violating any rules.\n- Matches the pre-filled values in the original Sudoku grid.\n\n### Step 4: Answer\nAfter analyzing all options, only Option D satisfies the Sudoku rules.\n\n\\boxed{D}", "ground_truth": "D", "prompt": "You need to solve a 9x9 Sudoku puzzle.\nYou need to solve a Sudoku puzzle of size 9x9.\n\n**Sudoku Puzzle Rules (9x9 grid):**\n1.  **The Grid:** The grid is a 9x9 square, further divided into each 3x3 subgrid (non-overlapping regions).\n2.  **The Goal:** Fill all empty cells in the grid with digits from 1 to 9.\n3.  **Constraints:** Each digit (1 to 9) must appear exactly once in:\n    a.

No two rows or columns can be identical.\n\nFrom the image, we observe that:\n- Red cells represent 1s.\n- Blue cells represent 0s.\n- The partially filled grid shows some 1s and 0s already placed.\n\n### Option Analysis:\n\n#### Option A:\n```\n1 0 1 0\n0 0 1 1\n0 1 0 1\n1 1 0 0\n```\n- Check for consecutive numbers: All rows and columns follow rule 2.\n- Count 0s and 1s: Each row/column has exactly 2 of each.\n- Uniqueness of rows and columns: All unique.\n\n#### Option B:\n```\n0 0 1 0\n0 0 1 1\n0 1 0 1\n1 1 0 0\n```\n- Decisive fact: First row has three 0s, violating rule 3 (equal 0s and 1s per row/column).\n\n#### Option C:\n```\n1 0 1 0\n0 0 1 1\n0 1 1 1\n1 1 0 0\n```\n- Decisive fact: Third row has three 1s, violating rule 3.\n\n#### Option D:\n```\n1 0 1 0\n0 0 1 1\n0 1 0 1\n1 1 0 1\n```\n- Decisive fact: Fourth row has three 1s, violating rule 3.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nAfter analyzing all options, only Option A adheres to all Binairo rules.\n\n\\boxed{A}", "ground_truth": "A", "prompt": "You need to solve a Binairo puzzle (Size: 4x4).\nYou need to solve a Binairo puzzle.\n\n**Binairo Puzzle Rules:**\n1.

{"question_id": "binairo_251", "response": "We're solving a 4x4 Binairo puzzle. The rules state:\n\n1. Each cell contains either 0 or 1.\n2. No more than two consecutive identical numbers in any row/column.\n3. Each row/column has an equal number of 0s and 1s.\n4. No two rows/columns are identical.\n\nFrom the image, we can deduce the following initial placements:\n\n- The second row's last cell is red (1), so the second row ends with '1'.\n- The first and fourth rows' second cells, and the first row's third cell are blue (0), giving partial configurations.\n- The third column's bottom cell is blue (0).\n\n\nLet's analyze the given options:\n\n### Option A:\n```\n1 0 0 1\n0 1 0 1\n0 1 1 0\n1 0 1 0\n```\nThis matches the initial clues from the picture:\n- Second row ends with '1'\n- First and fourth row have '0' in their second cell, and first row has '0' in third cell.\n- Third column's bottom cell is '0'.\nAll rows and columns have equal numbers of 0s and 1s with no three consecutive identical numbers, and no repeated rows/columns. It seems valid so far.\n\n\n### Option B:\n```\n0 0 0 1\n0 1 0 1\n0 1 0 0 \n1 0 1 0\n```\nDecisive Fact: The first row starts with three consecutive '0's, violating the rule.\n\n### Option C:\n```\n1 0 0 1\n0 1 0 1\n0 1 0 0\n1 0 1 0\n```\nDecisive Fact: The third row has three '0's, violating the equal count rule.\n\n### Option D:\n```\n1 0 0 1\n0 1 0 1\n0 1 1 0\n1 0 1 1\n```\nDecisive Fact: The fourth row ends with two '1's making four '1's total, violating the equal count rule.\n\n\nAfter analyzing all options, the only configuration matching the rules and initial placements is in Option A.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{A}", "ground_truth": "A", "prompt": "You need to solve a Binairo puzzle (Size: 4x4).\nYou need to solve a Binairo puzzle.\n\n**Binairo Puzzle Rules:**\n1.
