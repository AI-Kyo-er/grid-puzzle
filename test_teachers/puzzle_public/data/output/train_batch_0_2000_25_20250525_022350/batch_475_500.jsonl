Restating the Puzzle and Its Rules\nWe are solving an Aquarium puzzle on a 5x5 grid. The grid is divided into tanks by thick red lines. Our goal is to fill certain cells with water according to the row and column clues while adhering to the uniform water level rule within each tank.\n\n### 2. Extracted Information from the Picture\n- Row water counts: [0, 1, 1, 3, 4]\n- Column water counts: [0, 1, 2, 2, 4]\n- Tanks are defined by the thick red lines in the grid:\n    - Top-left square is its own tank.\n    - Second column has two separate tanks of height 2 each.\n    - Third column has three tanks of height 1, 2, and 2 respectively.\n    - Fourth column has a single tank spanning the full height of the grid.\n    - Fifth column has a single tank spanning the full height of the grid.\n\n**Key Observations from the Picture:**\n- The first row must have no water because of the row count of 0.\n- The fifth column must have 4 water cells because of the column count of 4.\n\n### 3.
