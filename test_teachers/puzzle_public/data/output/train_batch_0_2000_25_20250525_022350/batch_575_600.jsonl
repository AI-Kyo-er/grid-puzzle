For instance:\n\n- Top-left corner has an '8'.\n- Second row has '5', '6', '1' at specific positions.\n- Third row includes '1', '4', '7', '2', etc.\n\nThis data helps us eliminate incorrect solutions quickly.\n\n#### Option Analysis:\n\n**Option A:**\n- Fills the top-left corner with '8'.

There must exist a right answer, and you must choose one from them", "image_file": "kakuro_555.png", "success": true}
