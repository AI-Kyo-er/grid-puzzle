Option Analysis\n\n#### Option A:\n```\n3 1 9\n2 7 9\n6 4 7\n```\n- Row sums:\n  - 3+1+9 = 13 (not 9)\n  - 2+7+9 = 18 (valid)\n  - 6+4+7 = 17 (valid)\n- Column sums:\n  - 3+2+6 = 11 (valid)\n  - 1+7+4 = 12 (valid)\n  - 9+9+7 = 25 (not 21)\n\nSince **the first row sum is incorrect**, this option is invalid.\n\n#### Option B:\n```\n3 1 5\n9 7 3\n6 4 7\n```\n- Row sums:\n  - 3+1+5 = 9 (valid)\n  - 9+7+3 = 19 (not 18)\n  - 6+4+7 = 17 (valid)\n- Column sums:\n  - 3+9+6 = 18 (not 11)\n  - 1+7+4 = 12 (valid)\n  - 5+3+7 = 15 (not 21)\n\nSince **the second row sum is incorrect**, this option is invalid.\n\n#### Option C:\n```\n3 1 5\n2 7 9\n6 4 7\n```\n- Row sums:\n  - 3+1+5 = 9 (valid)\n  - 2+7+9 = 18 (valid)\n  - 6+4+7 = 17 (valid)\n- Column sums:\n  - 3+2+6 = 11 (valid)\n  - 1+7+4 = 12 (valid)\n  - 5+9+7 = 21 (valid)\n\nAll sums match the clues; thus, **this option seems valid**.\n\n#### Option D:\n```\n3 1 5\n2 7 2\n3 4 3\n```\n- Row sums:\n  - 3+1+5 = 9 (valid)\n  - 2+7+2 = 11 (not 18)\n  - 3+4+3 = 10 (not 17)\n- Column sums:\n  - 3+2+3 = 8 (not 11)\n  - 1+7+4 = 12 (valid)\n  - 5+2+3 = 10 (not 21)\n\nSince **multiple row and column sums are incorrect**, this option is invalid.\n\n---\n\n### 4.
