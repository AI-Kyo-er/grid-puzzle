{"question_id": "aquarium_84", "response": "Let's solve this Aquarium puzzle using the provided information.\n\n### Restating the Puzzle and Rules:\nWe are working on a 5x5 Aquarium puzzle. We know the number of water cells required for each row and column, along with the tank compartments created by the red lines. Water levels in each tank must be uniform.\n\nFrom the picture, we can see the following details:\n- Row water counts: [0, 0, 0, 3, 5]\n- Column water counts: [1, 1, 2, 2, 2]\n- Tank compartments:\n    - Top-left 3x3 area is one tank.\n    - Bottom-left 2x1 area is another tank.\n    - The middle-right 2x2 area forms one tank.\n    - The bottom-right 2x2 area forms another tank.\n\n### Option Analysis:\n\n#### Option A:\n```\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1\n```\n- Fifth row has 5 water cells, matching the clue.\n- Fourth row has 3 water cells, matching the clue.\n- However, the third column should have 2 water cells, but there are only 2 in the last two rows. Therefore, it does not satisfy the clue for column 3.\n\nThus, Option A is incorrect.\n\n#### Option B:\n```\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 1 0\n1 1 1 1 1\n```\n- Fifth row again satisfies the clue of 5 water cells.\n- Fourth row satisfies the clue of 3 water cells.\n- Third column now has 2 water cells as required.\n- Second column has 2 water cells, satisfying the clue.\n- Fourth and fifth columns each have 2 water cells, satisfying the column clues.\n\nOption B seems consistent so far; let's check the remaining options to ensure there isn't a better fit.\n\n#### Option C:\n```\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 1 1\n1 1 0 1 1\n```\n- Fifth row has only 3 water cells, not 5 as required.\n- Also, fourth row has 3 water cells correctly.\n- However, the third column has only 1 water cell, failing to meet the requirement of 2 water cells.\n\nThus, Option C is incorrect.\n\n#### Option D:\n```\n0 1 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 1 0 0 0\n0 0 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1\n```\n- Fifth row has 5 water cells, correct.\n- Fourth row has 3 water cells, correct.\n- But second column has 3 water cells instead of 1.\n- Third column has 2 water cells, which is correct.\n\nThus, Option D is inconsistent with the column clues.\n\n### Final Answer:\nOnly Option B satisfies all the given row and column water count clues while maintaining uniform water levels within tanks.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is \\boxed{B}.", "ground_truth": "A", "prompt": "You need to solve an Aquarium puzzle (Size: 5x5).\nRow water counts: [0, 0, 0, 3, 5]\nColumn water counts: [1, 1, 2, 2, 2]\nTank compartments: [[1, 1, 1, 2, 2], [1, 1, 1, 2, 2], [1, 1, 1, 2, 2], [1, 1, 3, 6, 6], [4, 5, 5, 6, 6]]\nYou need to solve an Aquarium puzzle.\n\n**Aquarium Puzzle Rules:**\n1.  **The Grid:** The grid is divided into several regions called \"tanks\" by the thick colored (red) lines.\n2.  **The Goal:** Your goal is to fill some cells in the grid with \"water\".\n3.  **Water Levels:** Within each tank, water must settle at a uniform level.
