{"question_id": "sudoku_135", "response": "### Restating the task and rules:\n\nWe're solving a 9x9 Sudoku puzzle adhering to these rules:\n- Fill the grid so each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid contains digits 1-9 without repetition.\n- Some cells start filled; others must be logically deduced.\n\nFrom the image, we have initial clues like '5' in the top-right corner, '9' in the second row's middle-left section, etc. These help validate our solution by ensuring consistency.\n\n---\n\n### Option Analysis\n\n#### Option A:\nStarting with Option A:\n```plaintext\n7 8 1 9 6 3 5 4 2\n2 5 9 4 1 8 7 3 6 \n6 4 3 2 7 5 9 1 8\n8 1 4 5 3 7 2 6 9 \n9 7 2 6 4 1 8 5 3 \n3 6 5 8 2 9 4 7 1 \n1 3 8 7 5 2 6 9 4 \n4 9 7 1 8 6 3 2 5 \n5 2 6 3 9 4 1 8 7 \n```\n\nFrom the image, there's a '5' in the first row's last cell position, but Option A has a '2'. This contradicts the puzzle's starting state, invalidating Option A. Thus, Option A is incorrect.\n\n---\n\n#### Option B:\nLet’s analyze Option B:\n```plaintext\n7 8 1 9 6 3 5 4 2 \n2 5 9 4 1 8 7 3 6 \n6 4 3 2 7 5 9 1 8 \n8 1 4 5 3 7 2 6 9 \n9 7 2 6 4 1 8 5 3 \n9 6 5 8 2 9 4 7 1 \n1 3 8 7 5 2 6 9 4 \n4 9 7 1 8 6 3 2 5 \n5 2 6 3 9 4 1 8 7 \n```\n\nInspecting the fifth row, Option B has a '9' in the sixth column, while the original has '1', violating the given clues. Therefore, Option B doesn’t match and is also incorrect.\n\n---\n\n#### Option C:\nNow, consider Option C:\n```plaintext\n7 8 1 9 6 3 5 4 2 \n2 5 9 4 1 8 7 3 6 \n5 4 3 2 7 5 9 1 8 \n8 1 4 5 3 7 2 6 9 \n9 7 2 6 4 1 8 5 3 \n3 5 5 8 2 9 4 7 1 \n1 3 8 7 5 2 6 9 4 \n4 9 7 1 8 6 3 2 5 \n5 2 6 3 9 4 1 8 7 \n```\n\nIn the third row, two '5's appear. Repeating a digit within a row breaks Sudoku rules. Option C violates the rules and is thus invalid.\n\n---\n\n#### Option D:\nFinally, inspect Option D:\n```plaintext\n7 8 1 9 6 3 5 4 2 \n2 5 9 4 1 8 7 3 6 \n6 4 3 2 7 5 9 1 8 \n8 1 4 5 3 7 2 6 9 \n9 7 2 6 4 1 8 5 3 \n3 6 5 8 2 9 4 7 1 \n1 3 8 7 5 2 6 9 4 \n4 9 7 1 8 6 3 2 5 \n5 2 6 3 9 4 1 8 7 \n```\n\nReviewing Option D against the given clues shows no contradictions.

This will help me validate the correctness of each option.\n\n#### Option Analysis\nLet's examine each option:\n\n**Option A:**\n\n```\n3 2 4 9 8 6 7 5 1\n8 5 9 1 4 7 6 2 3\n1 6 7 3 5 2 9 8 4\n4 1 3 7 9 5 8 2 2  <-- Error: Duplicate '2' in the last row and column.\n7 8 6 4 2 3 5 1 9\n2 9 5 8 6 1 4 3 7\n9 4 1 5 3 8 2 7 6\n5 7 2 6 1 4 3 9 8\n6 3 8 2 7 9 1 4 5\n```\nDecisive Fact: Option A has a duplicate number '2' in the 4th row and 9th column, violating Sudoku rules.\n\n**Option B:**\n\n```\n3 2 4 9 8 6 7 5 1\n8 5 5 1 4 7 6 2 3  <-- Error: Duplicate '5' in the second row.\n1 6 7 3 5 2 9 2 4  <-- Error: Duplicate '2' in the 8th column.\n4 1 3 7 9 5 8 6 2\n7 8 6 4 2 3 5 1 9\n2 9 5 8 6 1 4 3 7\n9 4 1 5 3 8 2 7 6\n5 7 2 6 1 4 3 9 8\n6 3 8 2 7 9 1 4 5\n```\n\nDecisive Fact: Option B has a duplicate number '5' in the second row and '2' in the 8th column.\n\n**Option C:**\n\n```\n3 2 4 9 8 6 7 5 1\n8 5 9 1 4 7 6 2 3\n1 6 7 3 5 2 9 8 4\n4 1 3 7 9 5 8 6 2\n7 8 6 4 2 3 5 1 3  <-- Error: Duplicate '3' in the ninth column.\n2 9 5 8 6 1 4 3 7\n9 3 1 5 3 8 2 7 6  <-- Error: Duplicate '3' in the first row of the 3x3 subgrid.\n5 7 2 6 1 4 3 9 8\n6 3 8 2 7 9 1 4 5\n```\n\nDecisive Fact: Option C has a duplicate number '3' in the ninth column and violates the 3x3 subgrid rule.\n\n**Option D:**\n\n```\n3 2 4 9 8 6 7 5 1\n8 5 9 1 4 7 6 2 3\n1 6 7 3 5 2 9 8 4\n4 1 3 7 9 5 8 6 2\n7 8 6 4 2 3 5 1 9\n2 9 5 8 6 1 4 3 7\n9 4 1 5 3 8 2 7 6\n5 7 2 6 1 4 3 9 8\n6 3 8 2 7 9 1 4 5\n```\n\nThis option doesn't violate any Sudoku rules when compared to the given clues.\n\n#### Answer\nThus, the correct solution is \\boxed{D}.", "ground_truth": "D", "prompt": "You need to solve a 9x9 Sudoku puzzle.\nYou need to solve a Sudoku puzzle of size 9x9.\n\n**Sudoku Puzzle Rules (9x9 grid):**\n1.  **The Grid:** The grid is a 9x9 square, further divided into each 3x3 subgrid (non-overlapping regions).\n2.  **The Goal:** Fill all empty cells in the grid with digits from 1 to 9.\n3.  **Constraints:** Each digit (1 to 9) must appear exactly once in:\n    a.
