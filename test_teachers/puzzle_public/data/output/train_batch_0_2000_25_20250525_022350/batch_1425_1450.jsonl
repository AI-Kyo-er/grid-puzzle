{"question_id": "aquarium_20", "response": "Let's solve this Aquarium puzzle step-by-step using the given options and the rules.\n\n### Restating the Puzzle and Rules:\nWe have a 6x6 grid divided into tanks by red lines. We need to fill each cell with 0 (empty) or 1 (water), following these guidelines:\n\n1. Water must settle uniformly within each tank.\n2. Row numbers indicate how many cells per row should contain water.\n3. Column numbers indicate how many cells per column should contain water.\n\nFrom the image, we extract the following details:\n\n- Row water counts: [2, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5]\n- Column water counts: [1, 0, 5, 5, 6, 6]\n- Tank compartments: Defined by the red lines in the grid.\n\n### Option Analysis:\n\n#### Option A:\n```\n0 0 0 0 1 1    [Fails column 1 clue]\n0 0 1 1 1 1\n0 0 1 1 0 1\n0 0 1 1 1 1\n0 0 1 1 1 1\n1 0 1 1 1 1\n```\nDecisive Fact: The first column has two '1's, but the clue indicates only one '1' should be present.
