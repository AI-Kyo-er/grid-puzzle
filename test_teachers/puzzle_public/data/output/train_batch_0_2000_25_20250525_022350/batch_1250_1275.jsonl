The picture provides a partially filled grid as the initial state.\n\n### Key Information from the Picture\nFrom the image, we can extract specific values placed in certain cells, such as:\n- First row: `5` at position (1,2), `8` at position (1,4), `1` at position (1,9)\n- Second row: `7` at position (2,2), `6` at position (2,3)\n- ... etc.\n\n\n### Option Analysis\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n#### Option A:\n- It matches the initial clues provided in the picture.\n- Cross-checking, no numbers are repeated in rows, columns, or 3x3 grids.\n\n#### Option B:\n- Fails immediately because the sixth row has two '2's (`... 2 1 2 ...`), violating the rule that no number repeats in a row. \n- This is a decisive fact that rules out Option B.\n\n#### Option C:\n- Matches the initial clues in the picture. \n- Checking for repeats: There are no duplicates found in rows, columns, or 3x3 grids.\n\n#### Option D:\n- Fails due to the ninth row containing two '9's (`... 9 6 8`), which violates the rule of no repetition within a row.\n- This is a decisive fact that rules out Option D.\n\n\n### Answer\nAfter evaluating all options, only **Option A** and **Option C** satisfy the Sudoku rules.

We have four options (A, B, C, D) and need to determine which is correct by checking against the initial clues.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Initial Clues from the Picture\nFrom the given image, we extract initial clues such as the placement of some numbers, like \"6\" in the top-left corner, \"1\" at the top second column, etc.\n\n### Option Analysis:\n\n#### Option A:\n```\n6 1 8 7 9 2 5 3 4\n2 9 4 5 1 3 7 6 8\n5 3 7 4 8 6 2 1 9\n4 6 2 8 3 9 1 5 7\n3 8 9 1 7 5 4 2 6\n7 5 1 2 6 4 8 9 3\n1 2 3 9 4 7 6 8 5\n9 4 5 6 2 8 3 7 1\n8 7 6 3 5 1 9 4 2\n```\n- Checking consistency with the initial clues, it matches perfectly.\n\n#### Option B:\n```\n6 1 8 7 9 2 5 3 4\n2 9 4 5 1 3 7 6 8\n5 3 7 4 8 6 2 1 9\n4 6 2 8 3 9 1 5 7\n3 8 9 1 7 5 4 2 6\n7 5 1 2 6 4 8 9 3\n1 2 3 9 4 7 6 8 4\n9 4 5 6 2 8 3 8 1\n8 7 6 3 5 1 9 4 2\n```\n- Decisive Fact: In the last row, there are two '8's which violates Sudoku rule.
