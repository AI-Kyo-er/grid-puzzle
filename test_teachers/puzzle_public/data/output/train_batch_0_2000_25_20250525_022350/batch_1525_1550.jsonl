{"question_id": "sudoku_602", "response": "We're solving a 9x9 Sudoku puzzle. The rules state that each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid must contain all digits from 1 to 9 without repetition. \n\nTo solve this, we will analyze options A, B, C, and D using the given puzzle layout. I'll extract key information from the puzzle image and apply it to eliminate incorrect options:\n\n### Extracting Key Information from the Image:\nFrom the top-left corner of the puzzle, we can see:\n- The first row has \"8\" at the start and \"2\" near the end.\n- The second row has \"6\", \"9\", \"8\" in the first three columns.\n- The third row has nothing filled.\n- Other significant clues like “6” at R4C1 and “2” at R6C2.\n\nNow, let's analyze each option:\n\n#### Option A:\nLet’s focus on the first few rows:\n```\n8 5 1 7 4 3 2 9 6 -> Matches initial clues.\n6 2 9 8 5 1 3 7 4 -> Matches initial clues.\n```\nNo immediate conflict found. Further verification needed but seems plausible.\n\n#### Option B:\nLooking at the first few rows:\n```\n8 5 1 7 4 3 2 9 6 -> Matches initial clues.\n6 2 7 8 5 1 3 7 4 -> Conflicts: Column 3 has two '7's.\n```\n**Decisive Fact:** B is invalid due to duplicate '7' in Column 3.\n\n#### Option C:\nChecking the first few rows:\n```\n8 5 1 7 4 3 2 9 6 -> Matches initial clues.\n6 2 9 8 5 1 3 7 4 -> Matches initial clues.\n7 4 3 6 9 2 8 5 1 -> No immediate conflict with clues.\n```\nNo conflicts so far; needs more verification.\n\n#### Option D:\nChecking the first few rows:\n```\n8 5 1 7 4 3 2 9 6 -> Matches initial clues.\n6 2 9 8 5 1 3 7 4 -> Matches initial clues.\n7 4 3 6 9 2 8 5 1 -> No immediate conflict with clues.\n1 1 8 4 7 5 6 2 9 -> Conflicts: Row 4 has two '1's.\n```\n**Decisive Fact:** D is invalid due to duplicate '1' in Row 4.\n\nThus, between A and C, we must verify remaining parts of the grids fully.
