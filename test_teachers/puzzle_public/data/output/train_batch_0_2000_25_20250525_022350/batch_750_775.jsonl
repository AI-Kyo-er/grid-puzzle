{"question_id": "binairo_302", "response": "Let's solve this Binairo puzzle following the given rules and analyzing the provided options:\n\n### Restate the Puzzle and Rules:\nWe're solving a Binairo puzzle on a 6x6 grid. The rules involve placing 0s and 1s such that there are no more than two consecutive identical digits in any row or column, each row and column has an equal number of 0s and 1s, and no two rows or columns are identical. Red represents 1, and blue represents 0. We'll determine the correct option based on these rules.\n\n### Extracted Information from the Picture:\nFrom the image provided, we have the initial placements:\n- Top-right corner: 1 (red)\n- Middle-right, third row down: 0 (blue)\n- Second row from the top, third column: 1 (red)\n- Third row from the top, second column: 1 (red)\n\n### Option Analysis:\n\n#### Option A:\n```\n0 1 0 0 1 1\n0 1 1 0 0 1\n1 0 1 1 0 0\n1 1 0 0 1 0\n0 0 1 1 0 1\n1 0 0 1 1 0\n```\nThis option respects the initial placements indicated in the picture and seems to satisfy all Binairo rules.

Therefore, **Option B** is incorrect.\n\n#### Option C:\n\n```plaintext\n3 6 8 4 7 5 2 9 1\n5 4 2 9 3 1 7 8 6\n9 7 1 2 8 6 3 4 5\n8 2 6 5 4 3 1 7 9\n1 5 9 7 2 8 6 3 4\n4 3 7 1 6 9 5 2 8\n2 8 5 6 9 7 4 1 3\n6 9 5 3 1 2 8 5 7\n7 1 3 8 5 4 9 6 2\n```\n\n- In the eighth row, there is a repetition of '5', violating the rule that each digit can appear only once per row. Therefore, **Option C** is incorrect.\n\n#### Option D:\n\n```plaintext\n3 6 8 4 7 5 2 9 1\n5 4 2 9 3 1 7 8 6\n9 7 1 2 8 6 3 4 5\n8 2 6 3 4 3 1 7 9\n1 5 9 7 2 8 6 3 4\n4 3 7 1 6 9 5 2 8\n2 8 5 6 9 7 4 1 3\n6 9 4 3 1 2 8 5 7\n7 1 3 8 5 4 9 6 2\n```\n\n- In the fourth row, there is a repetition of '3', violating the rule that each digit can appear only once per row. Therefore, **Option D** is incorrect.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nAfter analyzing each option and identifying rule violations in Options B, C, and D, **Option A** is the only valid solution that adheres to all Sudoku rules.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is \\boxed{A}.", "ground_truth": "A", "prompt": "You need to solve a 9x9 Sudoku puzzle.\nYou need to solve a Sudoku puzzle of size 9x9.\n\n**Sudoku Puzzle Rules (9x9 grid):**\n1.  **The Grid:** The grid is a 9x9 square, further divided into each 3x3 subgrid (non-overlapping regions).\n2.  **The Goal:** Fill all empty cells in the grid with digits from 1 to 9.\n3.  **Constraints:** Each digit (1 to 9) must appear exactly once in:\n    a.

Thus **incorrect**.\n\n#### Option C:\n```\n0 0 0 0 0 0    (0)\n1 0 0 1 0 0    (2 ≠ 1)\n1 0 0 0 0 1    (2)\n1 1 1 1 1 1    (6)\n1 1 1 1 1 1    (6)\n0 1 1 1 1 1    (5 ≠ 6)\n```\n- Row 2 needs 1 but has 2 filled cells. Thus **incorrect**.\n\n#### Option D:\n```\n0 1 0 0 0 0    (1)\n1 0 0 0 0 0    (1)\n1 0 0 0 0 1    (2)\n1 1 1 1 1 1    (6)\n1 1 1 1 1 1    (6)\n1 1 1 1 1 1    (6)\n```\n- Satisfies all row and column water counts correctly and maintains uniform water levels within tanks.\n\n### Conclusion:\nSince only Option D satisfies all conditions of the puzzle, the final answer is:\n\n\\boxed{D}", "ground_truth": "A", "prompt": "You need to solve an Aquarium puzzle (Size: 6x6).\nRow water counts: [0, 1, 2, 6, 6, 6]\nColumn water counts: [5, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4]\nTank compartments: [[3, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1], [2, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1], [8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4], [8, 8, 5, 7, 7, 6], [8, 8, 8, 8, 7, 7], [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]]\nYou need to solve an Aquarium puzzle.\n\n**Aquarium Puzzle Rules:**\n1.  **The Grid:** The grid is divided into several regions called \"tanks\" by the thick colored (red) lines.\n2.  **The Goal:** Your goal is to fill some cells in the grid with \"water\".\n3.  **Water Levels:** Within each tank, water must settle at a uniform level. This means: if a cell is filled with water, all cells directly below it *within the same tank* must also be filled, down to the bottom of that tank.\n4.  **Clues:** The numbers outside the grid indicate how many cells *in total* must be filled with water in that specific row (numbers on the left) or column (numbers on the top).\n5.  **Solving:** Use the numbers as clues to figure out which cells must be filled with water, ensuring that the water level rule within each tank is followed, until all numbers are satisfied.\n\n\nYour task is to choose the correct grid configuration from the options below that represents the solution to the puzzle. Each cell is represented by 0 (empty) or 1 (water).\n\nOption A:\n```\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 0 0 0 0 0\n1 0 0 0 0 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1\n```\n\nOption B:\n```\n0 0 0 0 0 1\n1 0 0 0 0 0\n1 0 0 0 0 1\n1 1 1 1 0 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 0 1\n```\n\nOption C:\n```\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 0 0 1 0 0\n1 0 0 0 0 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1\n0 1 1 1 1 1\n```\n\nOption D:\n```\n0 1 0 0 0 0\n1 0 0 0 0 0\n1 0 0 0 0 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1\n```\n\nPlease provide your answer as a single letter (A, B, C, or D) in \\boxed{} corresponding to the correct option.\nnPlease check carefully about each option and show your checking process.
