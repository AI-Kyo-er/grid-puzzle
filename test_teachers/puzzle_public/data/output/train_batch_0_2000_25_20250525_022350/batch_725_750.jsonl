The objective is to fill the grid such that each row/column sum matches the given clues, without repeating any digit within the same row or column segment.\n\n#### Step 2: Key Observations from the Provided Data\nFrom the picture (information provided):\n- The first row sum is 28. This means the numbers in the first row should add up to 28.\n- The first column sum is 34. This means the numbers in the first column should add up to 34.\n- No number repeats in a continuous row/column segment while satisfying the sum constraint.\n\n#### Option Analysis\n\n##### Option A:\n```\n9 7 2 6 1 3\n6 5 9 8 7 2\n8 6 5 1 9 9\n2 1 7 5 3 4\n4 3 6 7 2 8\n5 4 4 9 6 1\n```\n1.
