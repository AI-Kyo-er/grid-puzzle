The first two rows have a water count of 0, meaning they must remain empty.\n2. The third row has a water count of 1, so only one cell in this row must be filled.\n3. Rows 4, 5, and 6 have water counts of 6, indicating all cells in these rows must be filled.\n4. Columns 1 through 6 must have water counts of 3, 3, 3, 4, 3, and 3 respectively.\n\n### Option Analysis:\n#### Option A:\n```\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0\n0 0 0 1 0 0\n1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1\n```\n- It matches the row water counts completely.\n- It does not satisfy the water level rule in Column 4, which should have 4 water cells but has only 3.\n- **Decisive Fact:** Column 4 requires 4 water cells, but this option has only 3. Thus, A is incorrect.\n\n#### Option B:\n```\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 1 0 0\n1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1\n```\n- It matches the row water counts completely.\n- It satisfies the water level rule in all columns.\n- **Correct Option:** All criteria are met.\n\n#### Option C:\n```\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 1 0\n0 0 0 1 0 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1\n```\n- It doesn't match the row water count of Row 3 (which should be 1, but here it’s 2).\n- **Decisive Fact:** Row 3 should have only 1 water cell, but this option has 2.

Each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid follows all Sudoku rules.\n\n#### Option B\nLooking at Option B:\n```\n1 2 8 7 6 9 5 3 4\n4 9 7 1 6 3 8 2 6\n6 5 3 8 2 4 1 9 7\n8 4 5 6 1 7 2 1 3\n7 1 9 4 3 2 6 5 8\n2 3 6 5 1 8 4 7 9\n5 7 1 9 4 6 3 8 2\n3 8 4 2 7 1 9 6 5\n9 6 2 3 8 5 7 4 1\n```\n- In the second row, there are two 6s, violating the rule that each number must appear only once per row.\n\n#### Option C\nExamining Option C:\n```\n1 2 8 7 6 9 5 3 4\n4 9 7 1 5 3 8 2 6\n6 5 3 8 2 4 1 9 7\n8 4 5 6 9 7 2 1 3\n7 1 9 4 3 2 6 5 8\n2 3 6 5 1 8 4 7 9\n5 7 1 9 4 6 3 8 9\n3 8 4 2 7 1 9 6 5\n9 6 2 3 8 5 7 4 1\n```\n- In the seventh row, there are two 9s, breaking the Sudoku rules.\n\n#### Option D\nFinally, Option D:\n```\n1 2 8 7 6 9 5 3 4\n4 9 7 1 5 3 8 2 6\n6 5 3 8 2 4 1 9 7\n8 4 5 6 9 7 2 1 4\n7 1 9 4 3 2 6 5 8\n2 3 6 5 1 8 4 7 9\n5 7 1 9 4 6 3 8 2\n3 8 4 2 7 6 9 6 5\n9 6 2 3 8 5 7 4 1\n```\n- In the fourth row, there are two 4s, again violating Sudoku rules.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer\nSince options B, C, and D all violate the Sudoku rules while Option A adheres to all constraints, the correct answer is:\n\n\\boxed{A}", "ground_truth": "A", "prompt": "You need to solve a 9x9 Sudoku puzzle.\nYou need to solve a Sudoku puzzle of size 9x9.\n\n**Sudoku Puzzle Rules (9x9 grid):**\n1.  **The Grid:** The grid is a 9x9 square, further divided into each 3x3 subgrid (non-overlapping regions).\n2.  **The Goal:** Fill all empty cells in the grid with digits from 1 to 9.\n3.  **Constraints:** Each digit (1 to 9) must appear exactly once in:\n    a.

{"question_id": "sudoku_258", "response": "### Solving the Sudoku Problem and Choosing the Correct Option\n\n#### Restating the Problem and Rules:\n\nWe're solving a 9x9 Sudoku puzzle. The goal is to fill the grid so that each row, column, and non-overlapping 3x3 subgrid contains the digits 1-9 exactly once. Some cells are pre-filled as clues.\n\n#### Key Information Extracted from the Picture:\n\nFrom the image, the initial Sudoku grid has several pre-filled cells providing the starting point for solving the puzzle. Important cells include:\n- Top-left corner: `5`.\n- Bottom-center: `9` in the last 3x3 subgrid.\n- Various other cells like `1`, `6`, `3`, etc., scattered throughout the grid.\n\n#### Option Analysis:\n\nLet's examine each option to determine which one correctly satisfies the Sudoku rules:\n\n**Option A:**\n\n```\n5 4 9 1 7 6 8 3 2\n7 8 1 5 3 2 6 9 4\n3 2 6 4 9 8 7 1 5\n2 7 5 9 4 1 3 8 6\n9 6 3 7 8 5 2 4 1\n4 1 8 2 6 3 5 7 9\n6 9 4 3 5 7 1 2 8\n8 3 2 6 1 9 4 5 7\n1 5 7 8 2 4 9 6 3\n```\n- All rows, columns, and 3x3 subgrids contain digits 1-9 without repetition.\n- This option seems valid at first glance.\n\n**Option B:**\n\n```\n5 4 9 1 7 6 8 3 2\n7 8 1 5 3 2 3 9 4\n3 2 6 4 9 8 7 1 5\n2 7 5 9 4 1 3 8 6\n9 6 3 7 8 5 2 4 1\n4 1 8 2 6 3 5 7 9\n6 9 4 3 5 4 1 2 8\n8 3 2 6 1 9 4 5 7\n1 5 7 8 2 4 9 6 3\n```\n- The second row contains two '3's (`... 3 2 3 ...`), violating the Sudoku rule. Thus, **Option B is incorrect.**\n\n**Option C:**\n\n```\n5 4 9 1 7 6 8 3 2\n7 8 1 5 3 2 9 9 4\n3 2 6 4 9 8 7 1 5\n2 7 5 9 4 1 3 8 6\n9 6 3 7 8 5 2 4 1\n4 1 8 2 6 3 5 7 9\n6 9 4 3 5 7 1 2 8\n8 3 2 6 1 9 4 8 7\n4 5 7 8 2 4 9 6 3\n```\n- The second row contains two '9's (`... 9 9 ...`), violating the Sudoku rule. Thus, **Option C is incorrect.**\n\n**Option D:**\n\n```\n5 4 9 1 7 6 8 3 2\n7 8 1 5 7 2 6 9 4\n3 2 6 4 9 8 7 1 5\n2 7 5 9 4 1 3 8 6\n9 6 3 7 8 5 2 4 1\n4 1 8 2 6 3 5 7 9\n6 9 4 3 5 7 1 2 8\n8 3 2 6 1 9 4 5 7\n1 5 7 8 2 4 9 6 3\n```\n- The second row contains two '7's (`... 7 7 ...`), violating the Sudoku rule. Thus, **Option D is incorrect.**\n\n#### Answer:\n\nSince Options B, C, and D all fail due to repeated digits within rows, the only remaining viable option is Option A, which satisfies all Sudoku rules.\n\nThus, the final answer is: \\boxed{A}", "ground_truth": "A", "prompt": "You need to solve a 9x9 Sudoku puzzle.\nYou need to solve a Sudoku puzzle of size 9x9.\n\n**Sudoku Puzzle Rules (9x9 grid):**\n1.  **The Grid:** The grid is a 9x9 square, further divided into each 3x3 subgrid (non-overlapping regions).\n2.  **The Goal:** Fill all empty cells in the grid with digits from 1 to 9.\n3.  **Constraints:** Each digit (1 to 9) must appear exactly once in:\n    a.
