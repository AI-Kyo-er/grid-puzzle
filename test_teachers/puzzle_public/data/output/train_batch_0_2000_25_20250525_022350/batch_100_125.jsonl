We're looking for any immediate conflicts (a number repeated in a row, column, or 3x3 box) that would disqualify an option.\n\n### Option Analysis\n\n#### Option A:\nChecking the first row, no duplicates are found. Checking the second row, no duplicates either. But in the third row, there's a conflict:\n- Row 3: `6 5 3 4 1 7 8 9 2` → No conflicts.\n- Column 3: `9, 8, 3...` → No conflicts.\n- Checking 3x3 boxes, everything seems fine.\n\nNo immediate conflicts detected.\n\n#### Option B:\nChecking the third row:\n- Row 3: `6 5 3 4 1 4 8 4 2` → Two '4's appear!

Both Options A and D seem valid at first glance. However, since the instructions state there must be one correct answer among A, B, C, or D, and B & C are eliminated, comparing A & D is necessary.\n\nUpon careful comparison, both A and D have no immediate conflicts.
