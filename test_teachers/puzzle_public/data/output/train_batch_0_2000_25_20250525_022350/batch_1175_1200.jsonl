{"question_id": "sudoku_262", "response": "### Solving the Sudoku Puzzle  \n\n#### Restating the Puzzle and Rules  \nWe are solving a 9x9 Sudoku puzzle. The rules dictate that each digit (1-9) must appear exactly once in every row, column, and 3x3 subgrid. The puzzle begins with specific digits as clues.\n\n#### Key Information from the Picture  \nFrom the puzzle image, we have identified several pre-filled digits. For instance, the first row has \"8\" at the top-left and subsequent digits \"7\", \"4\", \"3\". This helps narrow down possibilities for the remaining cells.\n\n---\n\n#### Option Analysis  \n\nLet's check each option one by one:\n\n**Option A:**  \n```\n8 6 2 9 1 7 4 5 3\n5 3 1 4 6 2 7 9 8\n7 9 4 8 3 5 1 6 2\n4 7 5 6 8 9 3 2 1\n2 8 9 1 7 3 6 4 5\n6 1 3 2 5 4 8 7 9\n3 4 6 5 9 8 2 1 7\n9 2 8 7 4 1 5 3 6\n1 5 7 3 2 6 9 8 4\n```\n- **Verification:** We will verify if all Sudoku rules hold true for Option A. Upon inspection, all rows, columns, and 3x3 subgrids seem to contain each digit exactly once without any repetition.\n\n**Option B:**  \n```\n8 6 2 9 1 7 4 5 3\n5 3 1 4 6 2 7 9 8\n7 9 4 8 3 5 1 6 2\n4 7 5 6 8 9 3 2 1\n2 8 9 1 7 3 6 4 5\n6 1 3 2 5 4 8 7 9\n3 4 6 5 9 9 2 1 7   <--- Column 6 contains two '9's\n9 2 8 7 4 1 5 3 6\n1 5 7 3 2 6 9 8 4\n```\n- **Decisive Fact:** Column 6 contains two '9's. This violates the rule that each digit must appear exactly once in each column.\n\n**Option C:**  \n```\n8 6 2 9 1 7 4 5 3\n5 3 1 4 6 2 7 9 8\n7 9 4 8 3 5 1 6 2\n4 7 5 6 8 9 1 2 1   <--- Row 4 contains two '1's\n2 8 9 1 7 3 6 4 5\n6 5 3 2 5 4 8 7 9   <--- Column 5 contains two '5's\n3 4 6 5 9 8 2 1 7\n9 2 8 7 4 1 5 3 6\n1 5 7 3 2 6 9 8 4\n```\n- **Decisive Fact:** Row 4 contains two '1's and column 5 contains two '5's, violating Sudoku rules.\n\n**Option D:**  \n```\n8 6 2 9 1 7 4 5 3\n5 3 1 4 6 2 7 9 8\n7 9 4 8 3 5 1 6 2\n4 7 9 6 8 9 3 2 1   <--- Row 4 contains two '9's\n9 8 9 1 7 3 6 4 5   <--- Row 5 contains two '9's \n6 1 3 2 5 4 8 7 9\n3 4 6 5 9 8 2 1 7\n9 2 8 7 4 1 5 3 6\n1 5 7 3 2 6 9 8 4\n```\n- **Decisive Fact:** Rows 4 and 5 both contain two '9's, violating Sudoku rules.\n\n---\n\n#### Conclusion  \nOnly **Option A** adheres to all Sudoku rules, ensuring each digit appears exactly once in every row, column, and 3x3 subgrid.\n\nThus, the final answer is \\boxed{A}.", "ground_truth": "A", "prompt": "You need to solve a 9x9 Sudoku puzzle.\nYou need to solve a Sudoku puzzle of size 9x9.\n\n**Sudoku Puzzle Rules (9x9 grid):**\n1.  **The Grid:** The grid is a 9x9 square, further divided into each 3x3 subgrid (non-overlapping regions).\n2.  **The Goal:** Fill all empty cells in the grid with digits from 1 to 9.\n3.  **Constraints:** Each digit (1 to 9) must appear exactly once in:\n    a.
