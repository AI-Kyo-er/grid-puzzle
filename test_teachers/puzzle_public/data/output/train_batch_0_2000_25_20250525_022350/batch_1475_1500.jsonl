Some cells are already filled with numbers as clues.\n\n### Extracted Information from the Picture:\nFrom the provided Sudoku grid image, we've identified the pre-filled numbers as follows:\n\n- Row 1: 9, 4, 8, 3\n- Row 2: 4, 9, 8\n- Row 3: 7, 8, 5, 3, 4, 1\n- Row 4: 1, 6\n- Row 5: 8, 2, 5, 9\n- Row 6: 3, 1, 7, 4\n- Row 7: 3, 6, 4, 1, 5\n- Row 8: 5, 4, 2, 1, 3\n- Row 9: 2, 7, 4, 8\n\n### Option Analysis:\nNow let's examine each option and rule out incorrect ones by identifying any violations of Sudoku rules.\n\n#### Option A:\nChecking for any immediate rule violations:\n- Row 3 has two '6's, violating the row constraint. Thus, **Option A** can be ruled out.\n\n#### Option B:\nNo immediate obvious rule violations detected upon initial scan. We'll keep this for now and continue checking other options.\n\n#### Option C:\nChecking for rule violations:\n- Column 1 has two '2's, violating the column constraint. Thus, **Option C** can be ruled out.\n\n#### Option D:\nChecking for rule violations:\n- The top-left 3x3 subgrid has two '3's in the same box, violating the subgrid constraint. Thus, **Option D** can be ruled out.\n\n### Conclusion:\nAfter ruling out Options A, C, and D, the only remaining option is **Option B**, which does not have any visible violations upon initial inspection based on the provided rows and columns.\n\nThus, the correct answer is \\boxed{B}.", "ground_truth": "B", "prompt": "You need to solve a 9x9 Sudoku puzzle.\nYou need to solve a Sudoku puzzle of size 9x9.\n\n**Sudoku Puzzle Rules (9x9 grid):**\n1.  **The Grid:** The grid is a 9x9 square, further divided into each 3x3 subgrid (non-overlapping regions).\n2.  **The Goal:** Fill all empty cells in the grid with digits from 1 to 9.\n3.  **Constraints:** Each digit (1 to 9) must appear exactly once in:\n    a.
