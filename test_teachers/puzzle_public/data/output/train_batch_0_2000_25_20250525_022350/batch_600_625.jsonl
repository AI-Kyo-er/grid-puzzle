The goal is to fill each empty cell with digits 1-9 such that no digit repeats within any row, column, or 3x3 subgrid.

Therefore, **Option B is incorrect.**\n\n#### Examining Option C:\nIn the seventh row of Option C, there are two '3's (`4 3 3`). This violates the rule that a digit can't repeat within a row. Therefore, **Option C is incorrect.**\n\n#### Examining Option D:\nUpon close inspection, Option D seems valid according to Sudoku rules. To ensure accuracy, compare with the remaining valid option (A).\n\n\n### Final Comparison Between A & D:\n\nBoth options A and D have no visible immediate conflicts when scanning rows, columns, and 3x3 subgrids.

Thus:\n\n**Decisive Fact:** Option C has two '1's in the same column (second column), disqualifying it.\n\n### Option D:\n\nFor Option D, there's a problem in the first column.
