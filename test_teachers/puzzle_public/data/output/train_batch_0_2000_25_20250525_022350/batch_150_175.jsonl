Checking Option A\nAnalyzing the provided grid and comparing it against the original puzzle image:\n- Row-wise: All rows contain unique digits 1–9.\n- Column-wise: All columns contain unique digits 1–9.\n- Subgrid-wise: All 3x3 subgrids contain unique digits 1–9.\n- Matches all Sudoku rules and initial clues from the provided puzzle image. No conflicts identified.\n\n#### B. Checking Option B\n- In the initial puzzle image and Option B, there's a conflict in the bottom-left subgrid; the number '9' appears twice in the same column. This violates Sudoku rules.\n\n#### C. Checking Option C\n- In the initial puzzle image and Option C, the top-left subgrid does not match the original clues: The number '2' at the start of the first row doesn’t align with the given clue '4'. Also, multiple other conflicts arise when compared with the original clues.\n\n#### D. Checking Option D\n- In the initial puzzle image and Option D, there’s a conflict in the third row.
