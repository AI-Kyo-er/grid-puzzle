{"question_id": "sudoku_669", "response": "### Solving Sudoku Puzzle\n\n#### Step 1: Restating the Puzzle and Rules\nWe're solving a standard 9×9 Sudoku puzzle. The goal is to fill in all empty cells with digits 1-9 so that each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid contains all the digits from 1 to 9 exactly once. Some digits are pre-filled as clues. \n\n#### Step 2: Extracting Key Information From the Picture\nFrom the image, we clearly see the initial state of the Sudoku puzzle with several pre-filled numbers. We'll use these clues to examine each option:\n\n#### Option Analysis\n\n**Option A:**\n```\n6 4 2 8 7 9 3 1 5\n8 3 5 6 1 4 9 2 7\n9 7 1 3 2 5 4 6 8\n2 9 3 1 6 7 5 8 4\n5 8 6 9 4 3 2 7 1\n7 1 4 5 8 2 6 9 3\n1 5 9 7 3 6 8 4 2\n4 6 7 2 5 8 1 3 9\n3 2 8 4 9 1 7 5 6\n```\nChecking the rows, columns, and 3x3 grids doesn’t reveal any conflicts. Every number appears exactly once where required. So, we can't rule out Option A yet.\n\n**Option B:**\n```\n6 4 2 8 7 9 3 1 5\n8 3 5 6 1 4 9 2 7\n9 7 1 3 2 5 4 9 8\n2 9 3 1 6 7 5 8 4\n5 8 6 9 4 3 2 7 1\n7 1 4 5 8 2 6 9 3\n1 5 9 7 3 6 8 4 2\n4 6 7 2 5 8 1 3 9\n3 2 8 4 9 1 7 5 6\n```\nDecisive Fact: The third row has two '9's (`9 7 1 3 2 5 4 9 8`). This violates the Sudoku rule. Thus, Option B can be ruled out.\n\n**Option C:**\n```\n6 4 2 8 7 9 3 3 5\n8 3 5 6 1 4 9 2 7\n9 7 1 3 2 5 4 6 8\n2 9 3 1 6 7 5 8 4\n5 8 6 9 4 3 2 7 1\n7 1 4 5 8 2 6 9 3\n1 5 9 7 3 6 8 4 2\n4 6 7 2 5 8 1 6 9\n3 2 8 4 9 1 7 5 6\n```\nDecisive Fact: The first row has two '3's (`6 4 2 8 7 9 3 3 5`). This also violates the Sudoku rule. Thus, Option C can be ruled out.\n\n**Option D:**\n```\n6 4 2 8 7 9 3 1 5\n8 3 5 6 1 4 9 2 7\n9 7 1 3 2 5 4 6 8\n2 9 3 1 6 7 5 8 4\n5 8 6 9 4 3 2 7 1\n7 1 4 5 8 2 6 9 3\n1 5 9 7 3 6 8 9 2\n4 6 7 2 5 8 1 3 9\n3 2 8 4 9 1 7 5 6\n```\nDecisive Fact: The seventh row has two '9's (`1 5 9 7 3 6 8 9 2`).
