Puzzle Restatement & Key Information Extraction\nWe're solving a 9x9 Sudoku puzzle, where each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid must contain digits 1-9 exactly once. From the given partial Sudoku grid:\n\nThe key information obtained from the picture is:\n- Some cells are pre-filled, such as the top-left \"2\" and top-right \"5\".\n- The layout shows certain numbers already placed, like the \"9\" in the second row, third column.\n\n---\n\n### 2.

This option appears valid at first glance.\n\n#### Option B:\n```\n2 9 6 8 4 7 1 3 5\n3 8 4 9 1 5 6 2 7\n1 5 7 6 2 3 9 8 4\n5 4 3 1 8 6 7 9 2\n7 6 9 5 3 2 4 1 8\n8 1 2 4 7 9 5 6 3\n9 7 1 3 5 8 2 4 6\n4 3 5 3 6 1 8 7 9\n6 2 8 7 9 4 3 5 1\n```\n\n- Decisive Fact: The number \"3\" appears twice in the eighth row, violating the Sudoku rule that each row must have unique digits. Thus, **B is incorrect.**\n\n#### Option C:\n```\n2 9 6 8 4 7 1 3 5\n3 8 4 9 1 5 6 2 7\n1 5 7 6 2 3 9 8 4\n5 4 3 1 8 6 7 9 2\n7 6 9 5 3 2 4 1 8\n8 1 2 4 7 9 5 6 3\n9 7 1 3 5 8 2 4 6\n4 3 5 2 6 1 8 7 9\n6 2 8 7 9 4 3 5 1\n```\n\n- No immediate conflicts noted upon initial inspection.

Thus, **D is incorrect.**\n\n---\n\n### 3. Final Answer\nAfter eliminating options B and D due to duplicate numbers in rows, we are left with Options A and C, both seemingly valid at first glance.
