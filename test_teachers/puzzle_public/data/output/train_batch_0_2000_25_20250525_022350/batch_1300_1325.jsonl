{"question_id": "aquarium_294", "response": "Let's solve the Aquarium Puzzle step-by-step using the given information:\n\n### Restating the Puzzle and Rules\nThis is a 6x6 Aquarium Puzzle. The grid has tanks defined by red lines, with water settling uniformly within each tank. Row water counts are [0, 0, 1, 1, 3, 6], and column water counts are [1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 2]. We need to determine the correct grid configuration based on the options given.\n\n### Extracting Key Information\nFrom the picture, we observe:\n- The last row must have 6 water cells because its clue is 6.\n- The first two rows have a clue of 0, so they cannot contain any water.\n- The third and fourth rows have water counts of 1 each, indicating a single water cell in each row.\n- The fifth row has a water count of 3, meaning three water cells must be placed while maintaining uniform levels within tanks.\n- Column water counts dictate the vertical placement of water cells.\n\n### Option Analysis\n\n#### Option A:\n```\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0\n0 1 1 0 0 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1\n```\n- Row 5 has only 3 water cells, matching the clue.\n- Row 6 has all 6 water cells, matching the clue.\n- However, Column 4 does not meet the water count requirement of 1, as it has no water cells.\n- **Decisive Fact:** Column 4 lacks water, ruling out Option A.\n\n#### Option B:\n```\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0\n0 0 1 1 0 1\n0 1 1 0 0 1\n1 1 1 0 1 1\n```\n- Row 5 has three water cells, matching the clue.\n- Row 6 has five water cells but needs six.
