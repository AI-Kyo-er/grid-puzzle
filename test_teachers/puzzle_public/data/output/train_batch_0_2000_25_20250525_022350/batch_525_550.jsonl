{"question_id": "sudoku_492", "response": "### Restating the Puzzle and Rules\n\nWe're solving a 9x9 Sudoku puzzle following these rules:\n\n1. Each digit (1–9) appears once per row, column, and 3x3 subgrid.\n2. Given numbers act as clues to fill the remaining cells.\n\n### Extracted Information and Initial Analysis\n\nFrom the provided Sudoku board image, we have specific numbers in certain cells. For example, the top-left corner has \"1\", the second row's first cell has \"8\", and so on. We'll focus on critical cells and apply constraints to determine the correct option.\n\n### Option Analysis\n\n#### Option A:\n- In the last row (bottom), the number \"1\" appears twice (in columns 3 and 9). This violates the rule that each digit can only appear once per row.\n- **Decisive Fact:** This option is incorrect due to the repetition of \"1\" in the last row.\n\n#### Option B:\n- Examining the entire grid, there doesn't seem to be an immediate violation of Sudoku rules for rows, columns, or 3x3 subgrids. We will keep this option for now.\n\n#### Option C:\n- In the fourth row, the number \"5\" appears twice (in columns 5 and 6). This violates the rule that each digit can only appear once per row.\n- **Decisive Fact:** This option is incorrect due to the repetition of \"5\" in the fourth row.\n\n#### Option D:\n- This option seems consistent with Sudoku rules as well. We will confirm by comparing it more closely against the original puzzle setup.\n\n### Final Confirmation\n\nComparing Option B and Option D with the original provided grid:\n- Both seem valid at a cursory level.\n- However, in the bottom-right 3x3 subgrid, Option D places \"1\" in the bottom-right corner, while the original puzzle already has \"1\" in the same position as a clue.\n- **Decisive Fact:** Option D contradicts the initial given clue.\n\n### Answer\n\nThus, the only fully compliant option is \\boxed{B}.", "ground_truth": "D", "prompt": "You need to solve a 9x9 Sudoku puzzle.\nYou need to solve a Sudoku puzzle of size 9x9.\n\n**Sudoku Puzzle Rules (9x9 grid):**\n1.  **The Grid:** The grid is a 9x9 square, further divided into each 3x3 subgrid (non-overlapping regions).\n2.  **The Goal:** Fill all empty cells in the grid with digits from 1 to 9.\n3.  **Constraints:** Each digit (1 to 9) must appear exactly once in:\n    a.
