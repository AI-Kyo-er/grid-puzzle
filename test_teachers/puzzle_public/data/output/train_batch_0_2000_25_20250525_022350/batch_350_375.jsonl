{"question_id": "sudoku_380", "response": "### Restating the Problem\n\nWe're solving a 9x9 Sudoku puzzle. Our goal is to fill all empty cells with digits 1–9 while ensuring each digit appears exactly once in every row, column, and 3x3 subgrid.\n\n### Key Information from the Picture\n\nFrom the picture, we observe several pre-filled numbers. Key examples include:\n\n- Top row: `_, _, _, 9, 5, _, _, 8, 3`\n- Second row: `_, 6, _, _, _, _, _, 4, 9`\n- Etc...\n\nThis sets up constraints for solving, such as ensuring no duplicate digits in any group.\n\n---\n\n### Option Analysis\n\n#### Option A:\n```\n2 4 1 9 5 7 8 3 6\n8 6 5 1 3 2 7 4 9\n9 7 3 4 8 6 5 1 2\n3 1 2 5 6 4 9 8 7\n4 9 7 3 2 8 6 5 1\n5 8 6 7 1 4 3 2 8  ❌ \n6 3 8 2 9 1 4 7 5\n7 2 9 8 4 5 1 6 3\n1 5 4 6 7 3 2 9 8\n```\n\n**Analysis**: In Row 6, there's a duplicate \"8\" in Column 9. This violates Sudoku rules. **Option A is incorrect.**\n\n#### Option B:\n```\n2 4 1 9 5 7 8 3 6\n8 6 5 1 3 2 7 4 9\n9 7 3 4 8 6 5 1 2\n3 5 2 5 6 4 9 8 7  ❌ \n4 9 7 3 2 8 6 5 1\n5 8 6 7 1 9 3 2 4\n6 3 8 2 9 1 4 7 5\n7 3 9 8 4 5 1 6 3  ❌ \n1 5 4 6 7 3 2 9 8\n```\n\n**Analysis**: In Row 4, there's a duplicate \"5\" in Column 3. Also, in Row 8, there's a duplicate \"3\" in Column 2.
