{"question_id": "sudoku_439", "response": "### Restating the Puzzle and Rules:\n\nWe're solving a Sudoku puzzle on a 9x9 grid. The goal is to fill the grid so that each row, each column, and each 3x3 box contain the digits 1 to 9 exactly once. Some cells start with pre-filled numbers, and we must adhere to these clues.\n\n### Extracted Information from the Picture:\n\nFrom the provided Sudoku image, here's a partial representation of the initial numbers:\n\n```\n7 _ 1 _ _ 6 _ _ 4\n5 _ _ _ _ _ _ 3 _\n_ _ 8 _ _ _ 1 _ 9\n3 1 4 6 _ 5 _ _ 9\n8 _ _ 4 9 _ 3 2 _\n_ _ _ 3 _ _ _ 6 _\n_ 5 _ _ 6 3 _ 4 2\n_ 8 9 5 _ _ 6 _ 3\n_ _ _ 7 _ _ 1 _ _\n```\n\n### Option Analysis:\n\n#### Option A:\n```\n7 3 1 9 5 6 2 8 4\n5 9 2 1 8 4 7 3 6\n6 4 2 7 3 7 1 5 9\n3 1 4 4 2 5 8 9 7\n8 7 6 4 9 1 3 2 5\n9 2 5 3 7 8 4 6 1\n1 5 7 8 6 3 9 4 2\n4 8 9 5 1 2 6 7 3\n2 6 3 7 4 9 5 1 8\n```\n- **Decisive Fact:** In the third row, there are two '7's (`6 4 2 7 3 7 1 5 9`). This violates the rule that each number can only appear once per row. Thus, Option A is incorrect.\n\n\n#### Option B:\n```\n7 3 1 9 5 6 2 8 4\n5 9 2 1 8 4 7 3 6\n6 4 8 2 3 7 1 5 9\n3 1 4 6 2 5 8 9 7\n8 7 6 4 9 1 3 2 5\n9 2 5 3 7 8 4 6 1\n1 5 7 8 6 3 9 4 2\n4 8 9 5 1 2 6 7 3\n2 6 3 7 4 9 5 1 8\n```\n- **Decisive Fact:** This option seems to satisfy all Sudoku rules based on inspection of rows, columns, and 3x3 subgrids. No duplicates are found that violate the rules.\n\n#### Option C:\n```\n7 3 1 9 5 6 2 8 4\n5 9 2 1 8 2 7 3 6\n6 4 8 2 3 7 1 5 9\n3 1 4 6 2 5 8 9 7\n8 7 6 4 9 1 3 2 5\n9 2 5 3 7 8 2 6 1\n1 5 7 8 6 3 9 4 9\n4 8 9 5 1 2 6 7 3\n2 6 3 7 4 9 5 1 8\n```\n- **Decisive Fact:** In the second row, there are two '2's (`5 9 2 1 8 2 7 3 6`). This violates the rule that each number can only appear once per row. Thus, Option C is incorrect.\n\n#### Option D:\n```\n7 3 1 9 5 6 2 8 4\n5 9 2 1 8 4 7 3 6\n6 4 8 2 3 7 1 2 9\n3 1 4 6 2 5 8 9 7\n8 7 6 4 9 1 3 2 5\n9 2 5 3 7 8 4 6 1\n1 5 7 8 6 3 9 4 2\n4 8 9 5 1 2 6 7 3\n2 6 3 7 4 9 5 1 8\n```\n- **Decisive Fact:** In the third row, there are two '2's (`6 4 8 2 3 7 1 2 9`). This violates the rule that each number can only appear once per row. Thus, Option D is incorrect.\n\n### Answer:\n\nOnly Option B satisfies all Sudoku rules without any violations.\n\nThus, the correct answer is \\boxed{B}.", "ground_truth": "B", "prompt": "You need to solve a 9x9 Sudoku puzzle.\nYou need to solve a Sudoku puzzle of size 9x9.\n\n**Sudoku Puzzle Rules (9x9 grid):**\n1.  **The Grid:** The grid is a 9x9 square, further divided into each 3x3 subgrid (non-overlapping regions).\n2.  **The Goal:** Fill all empty cells in the grid with digits from 1 to 9.\n3.  **Constraints:** Each digit (1 to 9) must appear exactly once in:\n    a.

We have been provided with a partially filled Sudoku grid and four potential solutions (Options A, B, C, D). Our goal is to identify the correct completed Sudoku grid by eliminating incorrect options.\n\n---\n\n### Extracting Key Information\nFrom the image, I noted the following initial clues:\n- The top-right corner has '3' and '2'.\n- The second row has '2', '3', '7', '1', and '6'.\n- The third row has '6', '3', '1', '2', '5', and '7'.\nAnd so forth...\n\nThis information helps me check if the provided options adhere to these clues.\n\n---\n\n### Option Analysis\n\n#### Option A:\n1.

Third row: Has '6', '3', '1', '2', '5', and '7'. ✔\n\nHowever, there's a duplicate '2' in the fourth row (`7 2 2`). This violates the Sudoku rule that each number must be unique in a row. Therefore, Option B is incorrect.\n\n#### Option C:\n1. Check the top-right corner: Contains '3' and '2'. ✔\n2. Second row: Has '2', '3', '7', '1', and '6'. ✔\n3.
