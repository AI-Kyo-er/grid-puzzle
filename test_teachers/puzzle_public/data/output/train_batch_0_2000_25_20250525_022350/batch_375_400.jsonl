Given are the row water counts (`[1, 2, 4, 5, 5]`) and column water counts (`[4, 5, 3, 2, 3]`). The tank compartments are defined as per the tank numbers.\n\n#### Step 2: Analyze the Picture\nFrom the image, we observe that the tanks are structured in a way such that water levels in connected tanks can affect each other. For example, if a tank in the second column has water at a certain height, adjacent cells below it in the same tank must also be filled if they share the same tank number. This observation helps validate the correctness of the water placement in each option.\n\n#### Step 3: Option Analysis\n\n- **Option A:**\n  ```\n  0 1 0 0 0\n  1 1 0 0 0\n  1 1 1 0 1\n  1 1 1 1 1\n  1 1 1 1 1\n  ```\n  - Row 2 needs 2 water cells but has 1.
