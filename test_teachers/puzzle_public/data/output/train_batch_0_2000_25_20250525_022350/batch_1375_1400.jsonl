The puzzle starts with some cells already filled as clues, and we must use these clues plus the rules to determine the correct digit for each empty cell.\n\n### Information Extracted from the Picture\n\nFrom the Sudoku grid provided, the following clues are visible:\n\n- Row 1: 3, 4, 9, 1, 8, 5\n- Row 2: 1, 8, 5, 3, 4\n- Row 3: 9, 5, 6, 1, 7\n- etc...\n\nUsing these clues, we can now analyze each option.\n\n---\n\n### Option Analysis\n\n#### Option A:\n```\n2 3 4 2 9 4 6 8 5\n1 7 6 2 8 5 3 9 4\n9 5 8 4 3 6 2 1 7\n5 2 7 9 6 4 8 3 1\n4 6 1 3 2 8 5 7 9\n8 9 3 5 1 7 4 6 2\n6 8 5 1 4 9 7 2 3\n3 4 3 6 7 2 1 5 8\n7 1 2 8 5 3 9 4 6\n```\nDecisive fact ruling it out: In the first row, the number '2' appears twice, violating the Sudoku rule that each row must contain distinct digits from 1 to 9.\n\n#### Option B:\n```\n2 3 4 7 9 1 6 8 5\n1 7 4 2 8 5 3 9 4\n9 5 8 4 3 6 2 1 7\n5 2 7 9 6 4 8 3 1\n4 6 1 3 2 8 5 7 9\n8 9 3 5 1 7 4 6 2\n6 8 5 1 4 9 7 2 3\n3 4 9 6 7 2 1 5 8\n7 1 2 8 5 3 9 4 6\n```\nDecisive fact ruling it out: In the second row, the number '4' appears twice, again violating the Sudoku rule.\n\n#### Option C:\n```\n2 3 4 7 9 1 6 8 5\n1 7 6 2 8 5 3 9 4\n9 5 8 4 3 6 2 1 7\n5 2 7 9 6 4 8 3 1\n4 6 1 3 2 8 5 7 9\n8 9 3 5 1 7 4 6 2\n6 8 5 1 4 9 7 2 3\n3 4 9 6 7 2 1 5 8\n7 1 2 8 5 3 9 4 6\n```\nThis option matches all the given clues and does not violate any Sudoku rules at a glance.

{"question_id": "binairo_1040", "response": "**Puzzle Restated:** We are solving a 4x4 Binairo puzzle. The given partial grid has three cells colored red and one cell colored blue, representing 1s and 0s respectively. From the puzzle rules, we know:\n\n- Each cell must contain either a 0 or a 1.\n- There can be no more than two consecutive identical numbers in any row or column.\n- Each row and each column must contain an equal number of 0s and 1s.\n- No two rows or columns can be identical.\n\n**Information Extracted from the Picture:** The image shows a 4x4 grid with pre-filled values at certain positions, specifically red (1) and blue (0) squares. These indicate fixed points that any valid solution must adhere to when filling the rest of the grid.\n\n**Option Analysis:**\n\n- **Option A:**\n```\n0 1 0 1\n0 1 1 0\n1 0 1 0\n1 0 0 1\n```\nThis seems plausible initially; however, it does not match the given constraint of having a blue square (0) in the top-right corner.\n\n- **Option B:**\n```\n1 1 0 1\n0 1 1 0\n1 0 1 0\n1 0 0 1\n```\nHere, there are two consecutive '1's in the first row, violating rule #2. This option is ruled out.\n\n- **Option C:**\n```\n0 1 0 1\n0 1 1 0\n1 0 0 0\n1 0 0 1\n```\nThe third row contains three consecutive '0's which violates rule #2. Thus, this option is also incorrect.\n\n- **Option D:**\n```\n0 1 0 1\n0 1 1 0\n1 0 1 0\n1 0 0 0\n```\nSimilar to Option C, the last row of this option contains three consecutive '0's, violating rule #2. Hence, this option is invalid too.\n\n**Final Step:** While analyzing options B, C, and D, they were ruled out due to violating specific Binairo rules. However, neither of them align correctly with the known pattern from the image (the blue and red squares). Therefore, reviewing again:\n\nUpon closer inspection, **Option A** fits the initial setup since it has '0' (blue) in the top-right corner, but it otherwise appears correct in terms of rules.\n\nThus, the final correct option is: \\boxed{A}", "ground_truth": "A", "prompt": "You need to solve a Binairo puzzle (Size: 4x4).\nYou need to solve a Binairo puzzle.\n\n**Binairo Puzzle Rules:**\n1.
