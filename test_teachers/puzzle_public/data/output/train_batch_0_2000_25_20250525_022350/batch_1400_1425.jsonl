{"question_id": "aquarium_452", "response": "Let's solve the Aquarium puzzle based on the given information:\n\n### Restating the Puzzle Rules and Given Information:\n- The grid is divided into tanks by red lines. The objective is to fill cells with water while maintaining uniform water levels within each tank.\n- Row and column clues indicate the total number of water-filled cells in that respective row or column.\n- We have four options (A, B, C, D) as potential solutions, and we need to determine which one satisfies all puzzle rules.\n\nFrom the picture, I can see the following information:\n- The grid is divided into various tanks by the red lines.\n- Row water counts: [0, 1, 3, 4, 4].\n- Column water counts: [0, 2, 4, 3, 3].\n\n### Option Analysis:\n\n#### Option A:\n```\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 1 1 1\n0 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 0\n```\n- Row 2 (index 1) has a water count of 1 (correct as per the clue). However, in the second column, the water does not extend uniformly down the tank (it should go down to the bottom if filled), so this violates the uniform water level rule.\n\n#### Option B:\n```\n0 0 0 1 0\n0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 1 1 1\n0 1 1 1 1\n0 1 1 1 1\n```\n- The first column has 0 water cells as required but the last column has fewer water cells than the clue indicates (needs 3).
