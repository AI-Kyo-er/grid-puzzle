Restating the Problem and Rules:\nWe have a 9x9 Sudoku puzzle where we need to fill the empty cells such that each row, each column, and each 3x3 subgrid contains all digits from 1 to 9 exactly once. We're given options A, B, C, and D as potential solutions.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Key Information from the Picture:\nFrom the provided Sudoku grid, here are the key cells and sections to focus on when verifying the options:\n\n- **Top-left corner (3x3 box):** The first three rows and columns contain the numbers [2, 4, 3], [ , , 8], [ , 6, ].\n- **Middle section (cell at R5C5):** This cell is filled with \"3\".\n- **Bottom-right corner (3x3 box):** The last three rows and columns contain the numbers [ , , ], [3, , 2], [ , , 5].\n\n---\n\n### 3.

Thus, Option A is invalid.\n\n\n#### **Option B:**\n```\n2 4 3 7 1 5 6 8 9\n7 9 8 2 6 4 5 3 1\n1 6 5 3 9 8 7 2 4\n6 8 9 1 3 2 4 5 7\n3 5 1 4 7 9 2 6 8\n4 7 2 5 8 6 9 1 3\n5 1 4 9 2 3 8 7 6\n9 3 6 8 5 7 1 4 2\n8 2 7 6 4 1 3 9 5\n```\n- Check R8C3: Already verified that this does not violate any rules.\n\n#### **Option C:**\n```\n2 4 3 7 1 5 6 8 9\n7 9 8 2 6 4 5 3 1\n1 6 5 3 9 8 7 2 4\n6 8 9 1 3 2 4 5 7\n3 4 1 4 7 9 2 6 8\n4 7 2 5 8 6 9 1 3\n5 1 4 9 2 3 8 7 6\n9 3 6 8 5 7 1 4 2\n8 2 7 6 4 1 3 9 5\n```\n- Check R5C2: Contains \"4\" twice in the same row (R5), so Option C is invalid.\n\n#### **Option D:**\n```\n2 4 3 7 1 5 6 8 1\n7 9 8 2 6 4 5 3 1\n1 6 5 3 7 8 7 2 4\n6 8 9 1 3 2 4 5 7\n3 5 1 4 7 9 2 6 8\n4 7 2 5 8 6 2 1 3\n5 1 4 9 2 3 8 7 6\n9 3 6 8 5 7 1 4 2\n8 2 7 6 4 1 3 9 5\n```\n- Check R1C9: It has two '1's in the same row (R1), making Option D invalid.\n\n---\n\n### 4.
