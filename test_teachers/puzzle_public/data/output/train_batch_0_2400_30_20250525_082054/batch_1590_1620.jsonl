There is already one filled cell at the far right position. Therefore, the remaining three cells in this row must also be filled.\n   \n   ```\n   1 1 1 1\n   ```\n\n2. **Second Row:** Needs 4 filled cells. Considering the puzzle structure, filling any four positions within this row will satisfy the row constraint.\n   \n   ```\n   1 1 1 1\n   ```\n\n3. **Third Row:** Needs 2 filled cells.

{"question_id": "未知ID", "response": "To solve this Aquarium puzzle, let's follow these steps:\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n\n#### 1. Analyze Constraints and Initial Conditions:\n- The numbers at the top of each column and left of each row indicate the number of filled cells in that respective column or row.\n\n#### 2. Break Down the Problem:\n- **Row Constraints:**\n    - Row 1: 0 filled cells\n    - Row 2: 2 filled cells\n    - Row 3: 4 filled cells\n    - Row 4: 4 filled cells\n\n- **Column Constraints:**\n    - Column 1: 2 filled cells\n    - Column 2: 2 filled cells\n    - Column 3: 3 filled cells\n    - Column 4: 3 filled cells\n\n#### 3. Apply Logical Reasoning:\n\n**Row 1:**\n- Since there are 0 filled cells, all cells in Row 1 should be empty.\n- `0 0 0 0`\n\n**Row 2:**\n- Needs 2 filled cells. Based on column constraints:\n    - Column 1 needs 2 filled cells total, so one cell here is possible.\n    - Column 2 needs 2 filled cells total, so one cell here is possible.\n    - Columns 3 and 4 already have one filled cell (from row 3), so they cannot have another in row 2.\n- Therefore, possibilities can be `0 0 1 1` or `1 1 0 0`.\n\n**Row 3:**\n- Needs 4 filled cells. All cells must be filled.\n- `1 1 1 1`\n\n**Row 4:**\n- Needs 4 filled cells. All cells must be filled.\n- `1 1 1 1`\n\n#### 4. Validate against Column Constraints:\n- After filling as per above logic, check if columns meet their requirements:\n    - Column 1: `0 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 3` (but needs 2). So, Row 2 Column 1 must be `0`.\n    - Column 2: `0 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 3` (but needs 2). So, Row 2 Column 2 must be `0`.\n    - Column 3: `0 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 3` matches.\n    - Column 4: `0 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 3` matches.\n\nThus, we get:\n```\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 1\n1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1\n```\n\n#### 5.

{"question_id": "未知ID", "response": "To solve this Aquarium puzzle, we'll use the provided row/column constraints and fill the grid accordingly. Let’s break down our steps:\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n#### 1. Analyze the Constraints:\n- **Row Constraints**: \n    - Row 1: 1 filled cell\n    - Row 2: 2 filled cells\n    - Row 3: 4 filled cells\n    - Row 4: 4 filled cells\n\n- **Column Constraints**:\n    - Col 1: 4 filled cells\n    - Col 2: 3 filled cells\n    - Col 3: 2 filled cells\n    - Col 4: 2 filled cells\n\n#### 2. Fill the Grid Based on Constraints:\n\n##### Row 1:\n- Only 1 filled cell is allowed and since Column 1 needs 4 filled cells, that single filled cell must be in the first position of Row 1.\n\n```\n1 0 0 0\n```\n\nThis satisfies the Row 1 constraint and contributes one filled cell to Column 1.\n\n##### Row 2:\n- Needs 2 filled cells. Since Column 1 requires more filled cells, put another filled cell there. The second filled cell can only go in either Column 2 because Column 3 and Column 4 already have sufficient filled cells considered later.\n\n```\n1 1 0 0\n```\nThis satisfies Row 2 constraints and adds to Column 1 and Column 2.\n\n##### Row 3:\n- Needs 4 filled cells. Given the remaining requirements in columns, we fill all four positions.\n\n```\n1 1 1 1\n```\n\n##### Row 4:\n- Needs 4 filled cells. Similar to Row 3, we fill all four positions.\n\n```\n1 1 1 1\n```\n\n#### 3.
