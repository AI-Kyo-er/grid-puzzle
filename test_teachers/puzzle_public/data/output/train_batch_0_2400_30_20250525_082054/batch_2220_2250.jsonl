Examine the upper row:\n```plaintext\n2 > _ > 3 > 1\nWe can see that the only value that fits between '2' and '3' while maintaining the '>' condition is '4'.\nThis gives us: 2 > 4 > 3 > 1.\n```\n\n#### 2. Next, examine the second row:\n```plaintext\n3 > _ 1 _\nGiven the constraint that there are no repeats in rows or columns, we have:\n_ cannot be '1', '3', or any number already used in this row or column.\nSo the possible values for the blank are '2' or '4'.

Third row:\n```plaintext\n_ 3 _ 2\nThe first blank value in this row cannot be '2' or '3' and must fit the column constraints. Considering other values, it could be '1' or '4'.\nLooking at columns, if it is '1' then the final row must also contain '1', which is not feasible without violating the constraints. Hence, it must be '4'.\nThis gives us: 4 3 _ 2. Now, the middle value must be '1' since all other numbers are taken.\nThus, 4 3 1 2.\n```\n\n#### 4.
