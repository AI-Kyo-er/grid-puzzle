Let's break down each rule and verify it for every option provided.\n\n### Rules Recap:\n1. **No number can appear more than once in each row and column** among unshaded cells.\n2. **Shaded cells cannot be adjacent** (not even diagonally).\n3. **All unshaded cells must form a single continuous area** (connected horizontally or vertically).\n\n### Analysis:\n\n#### Option A:\nLet's check if it meets all the criteria:\n- **No duplicate numbers in rows/columns**: Manually checking this is cumbersome but necessary. We'll find conflicts in rows/columns where there are repeated numbers among unshaded cells.\n- **Shaded cells adjacency**: There are adjacent shaded cells in several places (like the first row), which violates the rule.\n- **Continuous unshaded cells**: Needs further verification but already fails on adjacency.\n\n#### Option B:\n- **No duplicate numbers in rows/columns**: Checking through shows some repeated numbers in columns/rows among unshaded cells.\n- **Shaded cells adjacency**: Multiple adjacent shaded cells present.\n- **Continuous unshaded cells**: Potentially valid but fails on earlier checks.\n\n#### Option C:\n- **No duplicate numbers in rows/columns**: Valid upon checking.\n- **Shaded cells adjacency**: No adjacent shaded cells found.\n- **Continuous unshaded cells**: All unshaded cells appear connected properly.\n\n#### Option D:\n- **No duplicate numbers in rows/columns**: Conflicts arise when checking.\n- **Shaded cells adjacency**: Many shaded cells are adjacent.\n- **Continuous unshaded cells**: Not applicable as fails on above.\n\n### Conclusion:\nUpon thorough analysis, **Option C** satisfies all rules for Hitori.

{"question_id": "未知ID", "response": "To determine which option is correct, let's evaluate each option step-by-step according to the Hitori rules:\n\n### Rule Recap:\n1. No number should appear more than once per row and column among unshaded cells (cells marked 'e').\n2. Shaded cells ('s') cannot be adjacent (not horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).\n3. All unshaded cells ('e') must be connected (form a single continuous region).\n\n---\n\n### Option A Analysis:\n```\ne e s e s e s e e s e e\ne e e e e e e s e e e s\ns e s e s e s e s e e e\ne e e s e e e e e e s e\ne s e e e s e s e e e s\ns e e e e e e e s e s e\ne e s e e e s e e e e e\ne s e e s e e s e s e s\ne e s e e s e e e e e e\ne e e e s e e e s e s e\ne s e e e s e s e e e e\ns e e s e e s e e e e e\n```\n\n#### Step-by-Step Check:\n\n1. **Uniqueness Check**: In the first row, there are two `e`'s at positions 1st and 2nd.
