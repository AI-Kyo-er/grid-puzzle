Since (1,2) > (1,3), it implies (1,2) = 4 and (1,3) = 2.\n- So, Row 1 becomes: `1 4 2 3`.\n\n**Row 2:**\n- Cell (2,1) = 3\n- Cell (2,4) = 2\n- The '>' at (2,3) means that (2,3) > (2,4). Thus, (2,3) can only be 4 since it should also be greater than its right neighbor 2.\n\nGiven these facts, let’s fill Row 2:\n- Possible values for (2,2) is 1 as rest are already used in this row.\n- So, Row 2 becomes: `3 1 4 2`.\n\n**Row 3:**\n- Cell (3,1) = 4\n- Cell (3,2) = 2\n- Cell (3,4) = 1\n\nGiven these facts, let’s fill Row 3:\n- Possible values for (3,3) is 3.\n- So, Row 3 becomes: `4 2 3 1`.\n\n**Row 4:**\n- Cell (4,1) = 2\n- Cell (4,2) = 3\n- Cell (4,3) = 1\n- Cell (4,4) = 4\n\nGiven these facts, let’s verify Row 4:\n- All values are consistent with other rows and columns.\n- So, Row 4 becomes: `2 3 1 4`.\n\n### Final Grid Solution:\nCombining all rows we get:\n```plaintext\n1 4 2 3\n3 1 4 2\n4 2 3 1\n2 3 1 4\n```\n\nThis matches Option A.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThus, the correct option is \\boxed{A}.", "ground_truth": "A", "prompt": "You are a Futoshiki player.
