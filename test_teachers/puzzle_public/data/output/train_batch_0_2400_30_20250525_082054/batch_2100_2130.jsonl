Incorrect.\n\n#### Option B:\n```\nw w b b\nw w b b\nb b w w\nb b w w\n```\n\n- **Row Check:**\n  - Row 1: `w w b b` – Two 'w's at start, then two 'b's.\n  - Row 2: `w w b b` – Identical to row 1.\n  - Row 3: `b b w w` – Two 'b's at start, then two 'w's.\n  - Row 4: `b b w w` – Identical to row 3.\n\nRows 1 & 2 are identical; rows 3 & 4 are identical.
