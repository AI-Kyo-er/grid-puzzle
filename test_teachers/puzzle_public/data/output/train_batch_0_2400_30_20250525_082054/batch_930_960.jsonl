{"question_id": "未知ID", "response": "To solve this Hitori puzzle, we'll follow the steps outlined in the prompt and apply the rules for shading cells while ensuring no two identical numbers remain in the same row or column among unshaded cells. Here’s the step-by-step process:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Puzzle Type and Rules\n\n- **No duplicates:** Each row and column must have unique unshaded numbers.\n- **Non-adjacency of shaded cells:** Shaded cells cannot be next to each other horizontally or vertically.\n- **Connectivity of unshaded cells:** All unshaded cells must form one connected region.\n\n### Step 2: Examine Initial Conditions\n\nGiven grid:\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}\n\\hline\n2 & 4 & 3 & 1 \\\\\n\\hline\n2 & 2 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n\\hline\n1 & 3 & 2 & 4 \\\\\n\\hline\n3 & 3 & 4 & 2 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Apply Logical Reasoning\n\n#### Row 1: \\(2 \\ 4 \\ 3 \\ 1\\)\nAll numbers are unique so none need to be shaded initially.\n\n#### Row 2: \\(2 \\ 2 \\ 1 \\ 1\\)\nHere, both 2s and 1s need to be handled. Let's consider possible shadings:\n\n- Shade the first 2 and second 1.\n- Verify non-adjacency, uniqueness, and connectivity later.\n\n#### Row 3: \\(1 \\ 3 \\ 2 \\ 4\\)\nAll numbers are unique, so none needs to be shaded initially.\n\n#### Row 4: \\(3 \\ 3 \\ 4 \\ 2\\)\nHere, both 3s need handling. Consider possible shadings:\n\n- Shade the first 3 and verify.\n\n### Step 4: Verify Against All Options\n\nUsing the above logic, let's verify each option with these guidelines.\n\n#### Option A:\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}\n\\hline\ne & e & s & e \\\\\n\\hline\ne & e & e & e \\\\\n\\hline\ne & s & s & e \\\\\n\\hline\ne & s & s & s \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n- In row 4, there are multiple adjacent shaded cells (violates non-adjacency).\n- In column 2, there are two '3's unshaded.\n\n#### Option B:\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}\n\\hline\ne & e & e & e \\\\\n\\hline\ns & e & e & s \\\\\n\\hline\ne & e & e & e \\\\\n\\hline\ne & s & e & e \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n- In row 2, it violates the rule as it has two '1's unshaded and two shaded '2's, breaking the rule.\n\n#### Option C:\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}\n\\hline\ns & e & e & e \\\\\n\\hline\ns & s & e & e \\\\\n\\hline\ne & e & s & s \\\\\n\\hline\ne & e & s & e \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n- It violates the column and row rules in multiple places.\n\n#### Option D:\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}\n\\hline\ne & e & e & e \\\\\n\\hline\ne & e & s & s \\\\\n\\hline\ns & e & e & s \\\\\n\\hline\ne & s & e & e \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n- Follows all rules:\n  - No two identical unshaded numbers per row/column.\n  - No adjacent shaded cells.\n  - All unshaded cells connected.\n\n### Final Answer\nThus, the correct grid is:\n\n\\(\\boxed{D}\\).", "ground_truth": "B", "prompt": "You are a Hitori player.

{"question_id": "未知ID", "response": "Let's solve the problem step-by-step according to the given Hitori rules.\n\n### Understanding the Rules\n1. Shaded cells cannot touch horizontally or vertically.\n2. Unshaded cells must form a single continuous area.\n3. No number can appear more than once in any row or column among unshaded cells.\n\n### Given Puzzle\nWe start with the provided grid:\n```\n3  4  2  1\n1  2  1  3   <- Black cell here indicates this '1' is already shaded\n4  4  3  3\n2  3  1  4\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n\n#### Step 1: Analyze Constraints and Start with Pre-Shaded Cell\nThe black cell at position (2,3) has the number '1', indicating it is a shaded cell. So, we'll mark it as `s`:\n```\ne  e  e  e\ne  e  s  e\ne  e  e  e\ne  e  e  e\n```\n\n#### Step 2: Eliminate Duplicate '1's in Rows and Columns\n- There is another '1' in the same row (row 2). It must be shaded (`s`):\n```\ne  e  e  e\ne  s  s  e\ne  e  e  e\ne  e  e  e\n```\n\n- There is also a '1' in column 3 (position 4,3). Since there's already a shaded '1' in the same column, this must be shaded as well:\n```\ne  e  e  e\ne  s  s  e\ne  e  e  s\ne  e  e  e\n```\n\n#### Step 3: Ensure No Adjacent Shaded Cells\n- Check for other duplicate numbers while ensuring no two shaded cells touch each other.\n\n#### Step 4: Address Duplicate '4's\n- In row 3, both '4's must not be both unshaded. Shade one of them (ideally the second one based on connectivity):\n```\ne  e  e  e\ne  s  s  e\ne  s  e  s\ne  e  e  e\n```\n\n#### Step 5: Check Connectivity and Final Adjustments\n- All remaining cells must ensure connectivity. Let's finalize with connectivity and non-duplicate row/column checks:\n```\ne  e  e  e    \ns  e  s  e    \ns  s  e  s    \ne  s  s  e  \n```\n\n#### Conclusion\nThis matches Option B.
