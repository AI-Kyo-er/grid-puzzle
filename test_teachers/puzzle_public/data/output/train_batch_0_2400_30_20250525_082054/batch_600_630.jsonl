Evaluating Options:\n\n**Option A:**\n```plaintext\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n```\n- Validates perfectly with the clues provided.\n- Rows and columns with '0' are empty.\n- Rows and columns with higher numbers like '8', '9', and '12' match the filled cells count.\n\n**Option B:**\n```plaintext\n0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n...\n```\n- Violates some basic rules as it fills non-consecutive cells without proper clue validation.\n\n**Option C:**\n```plaintext\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n...\n```\n- Some patterns violate continuous filling rules, especially around rows and columns with '8'.\n\n**Option D:**\n```plaintext\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n...\n```\n- Matches Option A but fails in one area where a '12' row isn't completely filled.\n\n### Conclusion:\nAfter detailed evaluation, **Option A** is the only configuration that satisfies all given clues logically and completely.\n\nThus, the final answer is \\boxed{A}.", "ground_truth": "D", "prompt": "You are an Aquarium puzzle player.

(Check for five consecutive cells filled)\n- **Row 6**: Needs 6 filled cells. (Check for six consecutive cells filled)\n- **Row 8**: Needs 8 filled cells. (Check for eight consecutive cells filled)\n- **Row 9**: Needs 9 filled cells. (Check for nine consecutive cells filled)\n- **Row 12**: Needs 12 filled cells.
