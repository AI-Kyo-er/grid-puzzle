This means four columns must have exactly 4 out of the 8 rows filled.\n\n#### Left Row Numbers\n- Rows have numbers like 0, 0, 3, 4, 3, 5, 5, 8. This means some rows must be entirely filled as per these values.\n\n### Step 3: Fill Based on Given Information\n\n#### Row Analysis\n- Rows 7 and 8 must be completely filled due to the value '8' for the bottom-most row.\n- Rows 6 and 5 should have five filled cells each.\n- Rows 4 and 3 must have corresponding counts as per their numbers while respecting the thick lines.\n\n#### Column Analysis\n- Column restrictions guide rows to have filled cells as per the number at the top.\n\n### Step 4: Test Each Option\n\n#### Option A\n```\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1\n0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0\n1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0\n1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n```\n- The last row has 8 filled cells correctly.\n- The fifth and sixth rows do not seem to meet the requirement of 5 filled cells each.\n\n#### Option B\n```\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1\n0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0\n1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0\n1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n```\n- The last row has 8 filled cells correctly.\n- The fifth and sixth rows do not seem to meet the requirement of 5 filled cells each.\n\n#### Option C\n```\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1\n0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0\n1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0\n1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n```\n- The last row has 8 filled cells correctly.\n- The fifth and sixth rows do not seem to meet the requirement of 5 filled cells each.\n\n#### Option D\n```\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1\n0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1\n0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0\n1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0\n1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n```\n- The last row has 8 filled cells correctly.\n- The fifth and sixth rows meet the requirement of 5 filled cells each.\n- And the other row constraints are met properly.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOption D meets all constraints accurately.

Understanding the Puzzle:\n- The numbers outside the grid indicate how many cells in each corresponding row or column should contain water.\n- Cells within the same \"aquarium\" must have the same water level.
