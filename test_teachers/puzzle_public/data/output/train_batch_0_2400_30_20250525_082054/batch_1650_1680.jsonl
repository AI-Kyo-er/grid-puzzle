{"question_id": "未知ID", "response": "To solve this Aquarium puzzle, we need to determine the placement of water according to the given constraints for rows and columns.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n#### Column Constraints:\n- The first two columns have numbers 2 each. This means that each of these two columns should have exactly 2 cells filled with water.\n- The last two columns have numbers 4 each. This means that each of these two columns should have exactly 4 cells filled with water.\n\n#### Row Constraints:\n- The top two rows have numbers 2 each. This means that each of these two rows should have exactly 2 cells filled with water.\n- The last three rows have numbers 4 each. This means that each of these three rows should have exactly 4 cells filled with water.\n\n### Filling the Grid Based on Constraints:\n\n#### Left Two Columns:\nEach column needs 2 filled cells. We can place them as follows while also considering row constraints:\n- The top-left corner has a 2x2 section which is separated. This means the top two cells will be filled for both columns.\n\nSo, the left 2x2 section is filled with water.\n\n#### Right Two Columns:\nEach column needs 4 filled cells. Since the first two rows have only two filled cells from the left side, the remaining 6 filled cells must be distributed over the bottom 3 rows.\n\nWe can fill the rest of the right two columns as follows:\n- The third row needs 4 filled cells, so we fill the entire row.\n- The fourth row also needs 4 filled cells, so we fill the entire row.\n- The fifth row needs 4 filled cells, so we fill the entire row.\n\nThis way, we satisfy all the row and column constraints.\n\n### Check Options Against the Solution:\n\nBased on our solution:\n\n- Option A does not match our requirement as it doesn't fill the required number of cells in some rows/columns.\n- Option B doesn't meet the criteria either, as it incorrectly places water.\n- Option D doesn't satisfy the row constraints properly.\n\nOption C matches our solution perfectly:\n\n```\n0 0 1 1\n0 0 1 1\n1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1\n```\n\nSo, the answer is \\boxed{C}.", "ground_truth": "C", "prompt": "You are an Aquarium puzzle player.
