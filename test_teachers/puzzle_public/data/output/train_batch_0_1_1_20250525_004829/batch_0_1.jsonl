{"question_id": "binairo_480", "response": "We're solving a Binairo puzzle. The red cells represent 1, and the blue cells represent 0. Here's the given grid with colors interpreted:\n\n```\n? 1 ? ?\n? ? ? ?\n? ? 0 0\n1 ? ? 1\n```\n\nLet's analyze each option to see if it fits the rules and the given clues:\n\n### Option A:\n```\n0 1 1 0\n0 0 1 1\n1 1 0 0\n1 0 0 1\n```\n\n1. Check the first row: `0 1 1 0` matches the pattern where the second cell is 1 and there's a 0 at the end. The row doesn't have three consecutive numbers and has equal 1s and 0s. \n2. Check the fourth row: `1 0 0 1` matches the pattern where the first and last cells are 1, and the middle two are 0. The row also has equal 1s and 0s.\n\nOther rows and columns seem valid on first glance.\n\n### Option B:\n```\n1 1 1 0\n0 0 1 1\n1 1 0 0\n1 0 0 1\n```\n\n1. First row has three consecutive 1s (`1 1 1`). This violates rule #2. So, **B** is incorrect.\n\n### Option C:\n```\n0 1 1 0\n0 0 1 1\n1 1 1 0\n1 0 0 1\n```\n\n1. Third row has three consecutive 1s (`1 1 1`). This violates rule #2. So, **C** is incorrect.\n\n### Option D:\n```\n0 1 1 0\n0 0 1 1\n1 1 0 0\n1 0 0 0\n```\n\n1. Fourth row does not have equal 1s and 0s (`1 0 0 0`). It has three 0s and one 1. This violates rule #3. So, **D** is incorrect.\n\nOnly Option A remains and fits all the conditions. Thus, the correct answer is:\n\n\\boxed{A}", "ground_truth": "A", "prompt": "You need to solve a Binairo puzzle (Size: 4x4).\nYou need to solve a Binairo puzzle.\n\n**Binairo Puzzle Rules:**\n1.  Each cell must contain either a 0 or a 1.\n2.  There can be no more than two consecutive identical numbers in any row or column (e.g., 000 or 111 are not allowed).\n3.  Each row and each column must contain an equal number of 0s and 1s.\n4.  No two rows can be identical, and no two columns can be identical.\n\nThe red represent 1 and the blue represent 0.\n\nYour task is to choose the correct grid configuration from the options below that represents the solution to the puzzle.
