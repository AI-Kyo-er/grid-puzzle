{"question_id": "aquarium_8", "response": "To solve this Aquarium puzzle, let's analyze the clues and apply the rules step-by-step:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Clues\n\n**Rows from Left:**\n- Row 0 has no clue, so we can't determine any water for sure yet.\n- Row 1 has a '0', meaning no water in this row.\n- Row 2 has a '2', meaning two cells in this row must have water.\n- Row 3 has a '3', meaning three cells in this row must have water.\n\n**Columns from Top:**\n- Column 0 has a '2', meaning two cells in this column must have water.\n- Column 1 has a '0', meaning no water in this column.\n- Column 2 has a '1', meaning one cell in this column must have water.\n- Column 3 has a '2', meaning two cells in this column must have water.\n\n### Step 2: Fill in the Cells Based on the Clues\n\n#### Row 1:\nSince the clue is '0', all cells in Row 1 must remain empty (filled with 0s):\n```\n0 0 0 0\n```\n\n#### Column 1:\nSince the clue is '0', all cells in Column 1 must remain empty:\n```\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n```\n\n#### Column 0 and Column 3:\nColumn 0 needs 2 water cells, and Column 3 needs 2 water cells. Also, Row 2 needs 2 water cells, and Row 3 needs 3 water cells. \n\nCombine these requirements with each tank's water level rule.\n\n#### Column 2:\nColumn 2 needs 1 water cell. It should be placed in such a way that it does not violate other requirements.\n\n### Step 3: Verify Option Choices\n\n**Option A:**\n```\n0 0 0 1\n0 0 0 0\n1 1 0 1\n1 0 1 1\n```\n- Row 2 has 2 water cells but they aren't in the same tank, invalid.\n\n**Option B:**\n```\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n1 0 0 1\n0 0 1 1\n```\n- Row 3 doesnâ€™t satisfy 3 water cells requirement.\n\n**Option C:**\n```\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0\n1 0 0 1\n1 0 1 1\n```\n- Row 1 has 1 water cell, invalid.\n\n**Option D:**\n```\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n1 0 0 1\n1 0 1 1\n```\n- Satisfies all row and column constraints correctly.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nThus, the correct solution is Option D.\n\n\\boxed{D}", "ground_truth": "D", "prompt": "You need to solve an Aquarium puzzle.\n\n**Aquarium Puzzle Rules:**\n1.  **The Grid:** The grid is divided into several regions called \"tanks\" by the thick colored (red) lines.\n2.  **The Goal:** Your goal is to fill some cells in the grid with \"water\".\n3.  **Water Levels:** Within each tank, water must settle at a uniform level.

Therefore, exactly one cell in this row should be filled with water.\n- Row 2 has a clue of 3. Therefore, three cells in this row should be filled with water.\n- Row 3 has a clue of 4. Therefore, all four cells in this row should be filled with water.\n- Row 4 has a clue of 4. Therefore, all four cells in this row should be filled with water.\n\n- Column 1 has a clue of 4. Therefore, all four cells in this column should be filled with water.\n- Column 2 has a clue of 3. Therefore, three cells in this column should be filled with water.\n- Column 3 has a clue of 3. Therefore, three cells in this column should be filled with water.\n- Column 4 has a clue of 2. Therefore, two cells in this column should be filled with water.\n\n#### Step 3: Fill the Grid Based on Clues\n\n- Since Row 1 needs only 1 filled cell and Tank 1 (top-left 2x2 area) must maintain a uniform water level, the only possible way is to have the first cell of Row 1 filled and the rest empty.\n\n- For Row 2, which needs 3 filled cells, considering the tanks and the uniform water requirement:\n    - The first cell cannot be filled because it would require the entire Tank 1 to be filled, which conflicts with the Row 1 clue.\n    - Hence, the last three cells should be filled to satisfy both Row 2 and Column 2-4 clues.\n\n- For Row 3 and Row 4, since they need all four cells filled, every cell in these rows will be filled.\n\n#### Step 4: Verify the Configuration\nCheck the proposed solution against all clues:\n- Row 1 has 1 filled cell, matching the clue.\n- Row 2 has 3 filled cells, matching the clue.\n- Row 3 has 4 filled cells, matching the clue.\n- Row 4 has 4 filled cells, matching the clue.\n\n- Column 1 has 4 filled cells, matching the clue.\n- Column 2 has 3 filled cells, matching the clue.\n- Column 3 has 3 filled cells, matching the clue.\n- Column 4 has 2 filled cells, matching the clue.\n\n#### Conclusion:\nThe configuration matches Option D.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{D}\n\\]", "ground_truth": "A", "prompt": "You need to solve an Aquarium puzzle.\n\n**Aquarium Puzzle Rules:**\n1.  **The Grid:** The grid is divided into several regions called \"tanks\" by the thick colored (red) lines.\n2.  **The Goal:** Your goal is to fill some cells in the grid with \"water\".\n3.  **Water Levels:** Within each tank, water must settle at a uniform level.
