This means no cells should be filled with water in these rows.\n    - Therefore, the first two rows must be completely empty.\n  \n- **Row 3:** Has a clue of `1`. There is only one tank in this row, so exactly one cell should be filled with water. Since water must settle uniformly, the only possible way to fill one cell is to fill the top cell in the tank (the rightmost cell, since it is the only cell in its tank).\n  \n- **Row 4:** Has a clue of `4`. There is only one tank in this row, so all four cells in this row must be filled with water.\n  \n- **Row 5:** Has a clue of `4`.

{"question_id": "aquarium_28", "response": "To determine the correct solution for the Aquarium puzzle, let's analyze the clues and apply the given rules step-by-step.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Tanks and Clues\n\nThe grid is divided into tanks by the red lines. We have:\n- One tank covering columns 1-2 and rows 1-3.\n- Another tank covering column 3 and rows 1-4.\n- The last tank covers column 4 and rows 1-5.\n\nThe clues indicate the number of filled cells per row and column:\n- Rows: [1, 1, 2, 4]\n- Columns: [2, 1, 1, 4]\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Each Tank and Fill Water According to Rules\n\n#### Tank 1 (Columns 1-2, Rows 1-3)\n- The clue for Row 1 is 1, so one cell must be filled. \n- The clue for Row 2 is 1, so one cell must be filled.\n- The clue for Row 3 is 2, so two cells must be filled.\n- Since water must settle uniformly, column 2 can't have any water above column 1 in this tank.\n\n#### Tank 2 (Column 3, Rows 1-4)\n- The clue for Column 3 is 1, so only one cell must be filled. \n- This water must settle at the bottom due to gravity.\n\n#### Tank 3 (Column 4, Rows 1-5)\n- The clue for Column 4 is 4, so four cells must be filled.\n- These will start from the bottom and go up, since water must settle uniformly.\n\n### Step 3: Fill the Grid Based on Analysis\n\nUsing the above analysis, let's fill the grid:\n\n- In Tank 1:\n  - Row 3 needs 2 cells filled. So, both Cells (3,1) and (3,2) must be filled with water.\n  - Row 1 and Row 2 each need 1 cell filled. Since there is already water in Row 3, Row 1 and Row 2 can only be filled in Cell (1,1) and (2,1) respectively to satisfy the uniform water level requirement.\n\n- In Tank 2:\n  - Only one cell in Column 3 must be filled, so Cell (4,3) will be filled.\n\n- In Tank 3:\n  - Four cells in Column 4 must be filled from the bottom. So, Cells (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), and (5,4) will be filled.\n\n### Step 4: Check Against Given Options\n\nNow, compare the filled grid with the provided options:\n\n- Option A:\n```\n0 0 1 1\n0 0 0 1\n1 0 0 1\n1 1 1 1\n```\n\n- Option B:\n```\n0 0 0 1\n0 0 0 1\n1 0 0 1\n1 1 1 1\n```\n\n- Option C:\n```\n0 0 1 1\n0 0 0 1\n1 0 1 1\n1 1 1 1\n```\n\n- Option D:\n```\n0 1 0 1\n0 0 0 1\n1 0 0 1\n1 1 1 1\n```\n\nOnly Option A matches our solution correctly.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe correct option is \\(\\boxed{A}\\).", "ground_truth": "B", "prompt": "You need to solve an Aquarium puzzle.\n\n**Aquarium Puzzle Rules:**\n1.  **The Grid:** The grid is divided into several regions called \"tanks\" by the thick colored (red) lines.\n2.  **The Goal:** Your goal is to fill some cells in the grid with \"water\".\n3.  **Water Levels:** Within each tank, water must settle at a uniform level.
