Thus, the first row should be `0 0 0 1 1`.\n\n- **Row 2 (2 water cells):** Similarly, the two rightmost cells in this row should be water (`0 0 0 1 1`), since they form part of the same tank.\n\n- **Row 3 (2 water cells):** The two rightmost cells in this row should be water (`0 0 0 1 1`), because they belong to the same tank.\n\n- **Row 4 (2 water cells):** Like the previous rows, the two rightmost cells should be water (`0 0 0 1 1`).\n\n- **Row 5 (3 water cells):** In this row, the three rightmost cells should be water (`0 0 1 1 1`).

To satisfy the '2' clue for both columns 1 and 2 while also matching the '2' and '3' row clues:\n    - Row 3 and Row 4 in this tank must contain water. Therefore, we can fill the first two cells of Row 3 and the first three cells of Row 4.\n  \n- For the remaining tank with a height of 2, and considering the '1' clue for column 3:\n    - Only one cell can be filled in this tank due to the row and column constraints.\n\n### Step 4: Check Options\n\n- Option A does not satisfy the column and row constraints fully.\n- Option B does not have any filled cells in column 4 despite having a '0' hint which seems incorrect.\n- Option C satisfies all the constraints:\n   - Row 1 and 2 empty.\n   - Two cells in Row 3 and three in Row 4.\n   - Column 1 and 2 have two filled cells.\n   - Column 3 has one filled cell.\n   - Column 4 has no filled cells.\n- Option D has an extra filled cell in column 4, violating the '0' rule.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nTherefore, the correct configuration is Option C.\n\n\\boxed{C}", "ground_truth": "C", "prompt": "You need to solve an Aquarium puzzle.\n\n**Aquarium Puzzle Rules:**\n1.  **The Grid:** The grid is divided into several regions called \"tanks\" by the thick colored (red) lines.\n2.  **The Goal:** Your goal is to fill some cells in the grid with \"water\".\n3.  **Water Levels:** Within each tank, water must settle at a uniform level.
