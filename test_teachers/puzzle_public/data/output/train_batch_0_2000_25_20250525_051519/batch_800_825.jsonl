Therefore, Option A is incorrect.\n\n#### Option B:\n```\n2 5 1 6 9 4 8 7 3\n9 3 6 5 7 8 4 1 2\n4 8 7 3 9 2 7 9 5\n1 4 8 7 2 9 3 5 6\n7 2 3 1 5 6 9 4 8\n6 9 5 4 8 3 1 2 7\n3 7 9 8 4 5 2 6 1\n8 1 4 2 6 7 5 3 9\n5 6 2 9 3 1 7 8 4\n```\n- In the third row, there are two '7's and two '9's, violating the rule that each number can only appear once per row.

Here is a detailed step-by-step analysis:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Grid and Clues\n\n#### Clues:\n- Top row: `0, 2, 2, 2, 2`\n- Left column: `0, 0, 0, 4, 4`\n\nThis means:\n- The first three rows have zero cells filled (across all columns).\n- The last two rows need four cells filled each (across all columns).\n\n### Step 2: Identify Tanks and Water Levels\n\nThe red lines divide the grid into different tanks. The tanks are:\n1. Top-left 3x5 area (rows 1-3)\n2. Bottom-left 2x2 area (rows 4-5, columns 1-2)\n3. Bottom-right 2x3 area (rows 4-5, columns 3-5)\n\n### Step 3: Fill Cells Based on Clues\n\n#### Rows 1-3:\nSince the clues for the top three rows are all zeros, no cells in these rows should contain water. Thus, the top-left 3x5 area remains empty.\n\n#### Rows 4-5:\nEach of these rows needs four filled cells. Given the tank boundaries, let's distribute the water accordingly:\n\n- **Bottom-left 2x2 area (rows 4-5, columns 1-2)**: Both cells in both rows must be filled to satisfy the clue of 4 cells per row while maintaining a uniform water level within the tank.\n  \n- **Bottom-right 2x3 area (rows 4-5, columns 3-5)**: All six cells must be filled to maintain uniform water levels within the tank and satisfy the clue.\n\nThus, we get this configuration:\n\n```\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 1 1 1 1\n0 1 1 1 1\n```\n\n### Step 4: Verify Solution Against Options\n\nMatching our solution with the provided options:\n\n- Option A: Matches perfectly\n- Option B: Last row has too many cells filled beyond what the tank allows.\n- Option C: Last row has too many cells filled beyond what the tank allows.\n- Option D: Additional cells filled incorrectly, not matching the uniform water level rule.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe correct option is **A**.\n\n\\boxed{A}", "ground_truth": "C", "prompt": "You need to solve an Aquarium puzzle.\n\n**Aquarium Puzzle Rules:**\n1.  **The Grid:** The grid is divided into several regions called \"tanks\" by the thick colored (red) lines.\n2.  **The Goal:** Your goal is to fill some cells in the grid with \"water\".\n3.  **Water Levels:** Within each tank, water must settle at a uniform level.
