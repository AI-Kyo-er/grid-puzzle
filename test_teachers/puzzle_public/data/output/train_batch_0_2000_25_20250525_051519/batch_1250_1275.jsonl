{"question_id": "aquarium_198", "response": "To solve the Aquarium puzzle, let's break it down step by step according to the rules and clues provided.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n#### Tanks Identification:\n- There are three tanks, separated by red lines:\n  - Tank 1: Top-left corner spanning 2x2 cells.\n  - Tank 2: Middle-right section, spanning 2x2 cells.\n  - Tank 3: Bottom-left section, spanning 2x2 cells.\n\n#### Analyze Clues:\n- **Row Clues (on the left):**\n  - Row 1: 0 (No cells filled)\n  - Row 2: 2 (Two cells filled)\n  - Row 3: 3 (Three cells filled)\n  - Row 4: 3 (Three cells filled)\n\n- **Column Clues (on the top):**\n  - Column 1: 3 (Three cells filled)\n  - Column 2: 3 (Three cells filled)\n  - Column 3: 0 (No cells filled)\n  - Column 4: 2 (Two cells filled)\n\n#### Solving Rows and Columns:\n\n- **Row 1:** The clue is 0. So no cells should be filled.\n  ```plaintext\n  0 0 0 0\n  ```\n\n- **Row 2:** The clue is 2. Since it spans two tanks, it can only fill two cells in the first tank:\n  ```plaintext\n  1 1 0 0\n  ```\n\n- **Row 3:** The clue is 3. It will fill up three cells in both the first and second tanks while respecting the water level rule:\n  ```plaintext\n  1 1 0 1\n  ```\n\n- **Row 4:** The clue is 3. It will similarly fill up three cells:\n  ```plaintext\n  1 1 0 1\n  ```\n\n### Verifying Columns:\n\n- **Column 1:** Three cells are filled correctly.\n- **Column 2:** Three cells are filled correctly.\n- **Column 3:** No cells are filled, which is correct.\n- **Column 4:** Two cells are filled, which is correct.\n\nThe final grid looks like this:\n\n```plaintext\n0 0 0 0 \n1 1 0 0 \n1 1 0 1 \n1 1 0 1 \n```\n\n#### Matching with Options:\nThis matches exactly with Option C:\n```\n0 0 0 0\n1 1 0 0\n1 1 0 1\n1 1 0 1\n```\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\n\\boxed{C}", "ground_truth": "C", "prompt": "You need to solve an Aquarium puzzle.\n\n**Aquarium Puzzle Rules:**\n1.  **The Grid:** The grid is divided into several regions called \"tanks\" by the thick colored (red) lines.\n2.  **The Goal:** Your goal is to fill some cells in the grid with \"water\".\n3.  **Water Levels:** Within each tank, water must settle at a uniform level.

Examine the Clues:\n- Row clues: 0, 0, 2, 2, 1, 3\n- Column clues: 4, 4, 0, 3, 2, 1\n\n#### 2. Analyze the First Tank:\nThe first tank covers the first two columns and the first three rows. According to the clues:\n- Row 1 has 0 water cells.\n- Row 2 has 0 water cells.\n- Row 3 has 2 water cells.\n\nSince water must settle uniformly within the tank, we can fill the bottom two cells in this tank as follows:\n```\n0 0\n0 0\n1 1\n```\nThis satisfies the row clues for rows 1 and 2 and part of row 3.\n\n#### 3. Analyze the Second Tank:\nThe second tank covers columns 3 and 4 and rows 3 to 5. According to the clues:\n- Row 3 has 2 water cells.\n- Row 4 has 1 water cell.\n- Row 5 has 3 water cells.\n\nGiven the previous filling, Row 3 already has 2 water cells, so we don't need to add any more. For Row 4, we can only add water to the bottom part of the tank, thus:\n```\n0 0\n0 1\n1 1\n```\nThis satisfies the row clues for rows 4 and 5.\n\n#### 4. Analyze the Third Tank:\nThe third tank covers the last two columns and rows 3 to 6. According to the clues:\n- Row 3 has 2 water cells.\n- Row 4 has 1 water cell.\n- Row 5 has 3 water cells.\n- Row 6 has 3 water cells.\n\nGiven the previous filling, Row 3 already has 2 water cells. For Row 4 and 5, we need to ensure the water settles uniformly:\n```\n0 0\n0 1\n1 1\n1 1\n```\nRow 6 requires 3 water cells, so we fill:\n```\n1 1\n```\n\n#### 5.

Starting from the smallest tanks:\n   - The small tank in the third column, second row, has a clue of 0. So it remains empty.\n   - Moving right to the larger tank in the third column, the clue is 3.

{"question_id": "kakuro_454", "response": "Let's solve the Kakuro puzzle step by step using the provided clues and rules.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the top row\n\nThe top row has a horizontal clue of 21 for three cells. The possible combinations of three different digits that add up to 21 are limited due to the constraint that no digit can repeat within the block. \n\nThe only valid combination here is:\n\\[ 9 + 8 + 4 = 21 \\]\n\nBut considering other clues, let’s explore further.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the second row\n\nThe second row starts with a 31 clue for four cells. Possible combinations respecting the no-repeat rule are very limited. One plausible set is:\n\\[ 9 + 8 + 7 + 7 \\]\nbut we realize 7 repeats hence not valid. The only correct set is:\n\\[9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 1\\]\n\n### Step 3: Cross-checking rows and columns\n\nWe will start filling the table based on our analysis while cross-checking every cell. We'll validate the sums for both rows and columns while ensuring no repetition.\n\nBased on the pattern and consistency:\n\n### Step 4: Validate each option\n\n- **Option A**:\n    - Top row sum: \\( 7 + 5 + 4 + 6 + 2 = 24 \\) (doesn’t match 21)\n    - Invalid.\n\n- **Option B**:\n    - Top row sum: \\( 7 + 5 + 4 + 6 + 2 = 24 \\) (doesn’t match 21)\n    - Invalid.\n\n- **Option C**:\n    - Top row sum: \\( 7 + 5 + 4 + 6 + 2 = 24 \\) (doesn’t match 21)\n    - Invalid.\n\n- **Option D**:\n    - Top row sum: \\( 7 + 5 + 4 + 6 + 2 = 24 \\) (matches 21)\n\nChecking other cells:\n\n#### Final Answer:\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]", "ground_truth": "A", "prompt": "You need to solve a 5x5 Kakuro puzzle.\n\n**Kakuro Puzzle Rules (5x5 Grid):**\n1. **Grid:** The grid is a 5x5 square, containing blank cells and clue cells.\n2. **Objective:** Fill all blank cells with numbers from 1 to 9.\n3. **Constraints:** Each digit (1 to 9) must satisfy the following conditions:\n    a.
