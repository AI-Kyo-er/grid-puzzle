Thus, both cells in columns 1 and 2 for rows 1 and 2 must remain empty.\n\n#### Row 3 and Row 4 Analysis:\n- Row 3 has a clue of 3.\n- Row 4 has a clue of 4.\n- Both tanks will likely be filled up based on these clues.\n\n#### Column 1 Analysis:\n- Column 1 has a clue of 1. Since Tank 1 spans columns 1 and 2, only one cell in the entire tank can be filled in column 1, but the water level constraint requires all cells in the same row within the tank to be filled. Therefore, no cells in column 1 should be filled.\n\n#### Column 2 Analysis:\n- Column 2 has a clue of 2. Given that Tank 1 spans columns 1 and 2, this column can accommodate up to two filled cells without violating water level rules.\n\n#### Column 3 and Column 4 Analysis:\n- Both columns have a clue of 4.

{"question_id": "aquarium_177", "response": "To solve this Aquarium puzzle, let's follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Tanks and Clues\n\nFirst, identify the tanks based on the red boundaries:\n- There are five tanks:\n  1. Top-left tank (2x2)\n  2. Top-right tank (3x1)\n  3. Middle-left tank (2x2)\n  4. Middle-right tank (3x3)\n  5. Bottom-left tank (2x2)\n\nNext, we will use the numbers outside the grid as clues for the number of filled cells per row and column.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Row and Column Clues\n\n#### Row Analysis:\n- Row 1 has a clue of 0, so no cells should be filled.\n- Row 2 has a clue of 2, meaning two cells should be filled.\n- Row 3 has a clue of 3, meaning three cells should be filled.\n- Rows 4 and 5 both have a clue of 3, meaning three cells should be filled.\n\n#### Column Analysis:\n- Column 1 has a clue of 4, meaning four cells should be filled.\n- Column 2 has a clue of 4, meaning four cells should be filled.\n- Columns 3 and 4 both have a clue of 3, meaning three cells should be filled.\n- Column 5 has a clue of 0, so no cells should be filled.\n\n### Step 3: Fill the Cells Based on Constraints\n\n#### Tank 1 (top-left 2x2):\n- It must have 2 water cells per its row clue.\n- Since the first row of the entire grid cannot have any water, the water must fill the second row.\n\n#### Tank 2 (top-right 3x1):\n- It cannot have any water because the top row cannot have any water.\n\n#### Tank 3 (middle-left 2x2):\n- It must have 2 water cells per its column clue.\n- Since the first row of the entire grid cannot have any water, the water must fill the second row.\n\n#### Tank 4 (middle-right 3x3):\n- It must have 3 water cells per its row and column clues.\n- The water can fill the second, third, and fourth rows to meet the criteria.\n\n#### Tank 5 (bottom-left 2x2):\n- It must have 2 water cells per its column clue.\n- Since the first row of this tank cannot have water, the water must fill the second row.\n\n### Step 4: Verify the Solution\n\nAfter filling the cells according to these rules, check the total count of filled cells per row and column:\n- Row 1: 0 filled cells (as expected)\n- Row 2: 2 filled cells (as expected)\n- Row 3: 3 filled cells (as expected)\n- Row 4: 3 filled cells (as expected)\n- Row 5: 3 filled cells (as expected)\n\n- Column 1: 4 filled cells (as expected)\n- Column 2: 4 filled cells (as expected)\n- Column 3: 3 filled cells (as expected)\n- Column 4: 3 filled cells (as expected)\n- Column 5: 0 filled cells (as expected)\n\nThus, the correct grid configuration that satisfies all the rules is:\n\nOption A:\n```\n0 0 0 0 0\n1 1 0 0 0\n1 1 1 0 0\n1 1 1 0 0\n1 1 1 0 0\n```\n\nTherefore, the correct option is \\boxed{A}.", "ground_truth": "A", "prompt": "You need to solve an Aquarium puzzle.\n\n**Aquarium Puzzle Rules:**\n1.  **The Grid:** The grid is divided into several regions called \"tanks\" by the thick colored (red) lines.\n2.  **The Goal:** Your goal is to fill some cells in the grid with \"water\".\n3.  **Water Levels:** Within each tank, water must settle at a uniform level.

Analyze Clues for Rows:\n- The leftmost column has clues `[1, 1, 6, 6, 6, 6]` meaning:\n  - Row 1 and Row 2 should have exactly one cell filled with water.\n  - Rows 3, 4, 5, and 6 should have six cells filled with water.\n\n#### 2. Analyze Clues for Columns:\n- The topmost row has clues `[6, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]` meaning:\n  - Column 1 should have six cells filled with water.\n  - Columns 2 to 6 should have four cells filled with water.\n\n#### 3. Consider Tanks and Fill Cells:\n- Tank on the far left column is only a single cell wide but spans the entire height. Thus, based on the left clue `[1, 1, 6, 6, 6, 6]`, we can fill the first two cells of the left column and the next four rows completely.\n  \n  ```\n  1 _ _ _ _ _\n  1 _ _ _ _ _\n  1 _ _ _ _ _\n  1 _ _ _ _ _\n  1 _ _ _ _ _\n  1 _ _ _ _ _\n  ```\n\n- Next, look at the tanks on the right side. These tanks span multiple columns. To satisfy the column clues `[4, 4, 4, 4, 4]`, each tank must have four cells filled with water. Also, ensure the row constraints are met.\n\n#### 4.

{"question_id": "aquarium_692", "response": "To solve the Aquarium puzzle, let's go through the steps systematically while checking the constraints provided by the numbers around the grid.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n#### Analyzing the Rows & Columns:\n\n1. **Row Analysis:**\n\n   - Row 1 has a clue `2`. It has two tanks. This means exactly two cells in this row should be filled such that they satisfy the water level constraint within their respective tanks.\n   \n   - Row 2 has a clue `2`. It also has two tanks. Thus, again, two cells need to be filled satisfying the water level within their respective tanks.\n   \n   - Row 3 has a clue `2`. It has one larger tank spanning across two columns. Both cells in this row should be filled up to the same level.\n   \n   - Row 4 has a clue `3`. It has three tanks spanning across two columns each. Three cells in this row should be filled, maintaining water levels.\n   \n   - Row 5 has a clue `3`. It also spans across various tanks which needs filling up to maintain water levels.\n\n2. **Column Analysis:**\n\n   - Column 1 has a clue `5`. So, all five cells in this column must be filled.\n   \n   - Column 2 has a clue `5`. Similar to column 1, all five cells in this column should be filled.\n   \n   - Column 3 has a clue `2`. Two out of its three cells should be filled.\n   \n   - Column 4 has a clue `0`. No cells in this column should be filled.\n   \n   - Column 5 has a clue `0`. Same, no cells in this column should be filled.\n\n#### Filling the Grid According to Constraints:\n\n1. Columns 1 and 2 have all cells filled due to their clues being `5`.\n2. Column 4 and Column 5 remain empty as their clues are `0`.\n\nSo far, we've identified:\n```\n1 1 0 0 0\n1 1 0 0 0\n1 1 0 0 0\n1 1 0 0 0\n1 1 0 0 0\n```\n\n3.
