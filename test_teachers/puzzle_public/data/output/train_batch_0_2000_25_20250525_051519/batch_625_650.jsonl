{"question_id": "aquarium_535", "response": "To solve this Aquarium puzzle, we will follow the rules and clues carefully, filling each tank with water to meet the specified number of filled cells per row and column while maintaining uniform water levels within each tank.\n\n### Step-by-step Solution\n\n#### Tank Analysis:\n\n- **Tank 1 (leftmost part of rows 1 and 2):**\n  - Row clues: Both rows 1 and 2 have a clue of '2'.\n  - The tank can only hold two columns fully filled with water up to its boundary to satisfy both row clues.\n\n- **Tank 2 (spanning columns 1-4 in rows 3-6):**\n  - Row clues: Rows 3 and 4 have a '3' clue; rows 5 and 6 have a '5' clue.\n  - Column clues: Columns 1 and 2 have '5' clues, so these must be completely filled.\n  - For columns 3 and 4, they should partially fill based on the row clues but maintain water levels.\n\n- **Tank 3 (rightmost part of rows 3-6):**\n  - Row clues: Rows 3 and 4 have a '3' clue, meaning 2 additional filled cells beyond the '5' filled in columns 1 and 2.\n  - Columns 5 and 6 have a '2' clue, meaning only those last 2 cells filled in row 4.\n\n### Verifying Options:\n\n**Option A:**\n```\n1 1 0 0 0\n1 1 0 0 0\n1 1 1 0 1\n1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1\n```\n- Column 4 does not meet its required count (should be 0 filled, but has 2).\n- Does not comply with the row clues for row 3 ('3' clue but has 4 filled).\n\n**Option B:**\n```\n1 1 0 0 0\n1 1 0 0 0\n1 1 1 0 0\n1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1\n```\n- Meets all row and column clues perfectly and adheres to the uniform water levels in each tank.\n\n**Option C:**\n```\n0 1 0 0 0\n1 0 0 0 0\n1 1 1 0 0\n1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1\n```\n- Violates row clues for row 1 and 2 (both '2', but here only one filled each).\n\n**Option D:**\n```\n1 1 0 0 0\n1 1 0 0 0\n1 1 1 0 0\n1 1 1 0 1\n1 1 1 1 1\n```\n- Violates column clue for column 4 (row 4, should be empty but filled).\n\n### Conclusion:\nOnly **Option B** satisfies all rules and clues correctly. \n\nThus, the final answer is \\(\\boxed{B}\\).", "ground_truth": "B", "prompt": "You need to solve an Aquarium puzzle.\n\n**Aquarium Puzzle Rules:**\n1.  **The Grid:** The grid is divided into several regions called \"tanks\" by the thick colored (red) lines.\n2.  **The Goal:** Your goal is to fill some cells in the grid with \"water\".\n3.  **Water Levels:** Within each tank, water must settle at a uniform level. This means: if a cell is filled with water, all cells directly below it *within the same tank* must also be filled, down to the bottom of that tank.\n4.  **Clues:** The numbers outside the grid indicate how many cells *in total* must be filled with water in that specific row (numbers on the left) or column (numbers on the top).\n5.  **Solving:** Use the numbers as clues to figure out which cells must be filled with water, ensuring that the water level rule within each tank is followed, until all numbers are satisfied.\n\n\nYour task is to choose the correct grid configuration from the options below that represents the solution to the puzzle. Each cell is represented by 0 (empty) or 1 (water).\n\nOption A:\n```\n1 1 0 0 0\n1 1 0 0 0\n1 1 1 0 1\n1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1\n```\n\nOption B:\n```\n1 1 0 0 0\n1 1 0 0 0\n1 1 1 0 0\n1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1\n```\n\nOption C:\n```\n0 1 0 0 0\n1 0 0 0 0\n1 1 1 0 0\n1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1\n```\n\nOption D:\n```\n1 1 0 0 0\n1 1 0 0 0\n1 1 1 0 0\n1 1 1 0 1\n1 1 1 1 1\n```\n\nPlease provide your answer as a single letter (A, B, C, or D) in \\boxed{} corresponding to the correct option.\nLet's think step by step:\n\n                                1.
