Thus, no cells should contain water in these two rows.\n   - The third row has a clue of '2', meaning there should be 2 filled cells in this row.\n   - The fourth row also has a clue of '2'.\n   - The fifth row has a clue of '3', indicating 3 filled cells.\n   - For the columns:\n     - The first two columns have a clue of '3', meaning there should be 3 filled cells in these columns.\n     - The third column has a clue of '1'.\n     - The last two columns have a clue of '0'.\n\n2. **Fill the Tank with Water:**\n   - In the first two columns, three cells must be filled with water. Since the first two rows are empty, the only way to satisfy this clue is to fill the third, fourth, and fifth rows' first two cells.\n   - In the third column, there's only one cell that can hold water without violating the row clues, so it will be the bottom cell of the tank in the third column (fifth row).\n   - The last two columns should remain empty since their clues are '0'.\n\n3. **Verify the Solution:**\n   - Check each row and column to ensure they match the given clues.\n\nFrom the above analysis, Option D satisfies all the rules and clues:\n\n```\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n1 1 0 0 0\n1 1 0 0 0\n1 1 0 0 0\n```\n\nThus, the correct answer is \\boxed{D}.", "ground_truth": "B", "prompt": "You need to solve an Aquarium puzzle.\n\n**Aquarium Puzzle Rules:**\n1.  **The Grid:** The grid is divided into several regions called \"tanks\" by the thick colored (red) lines.\n2.  **The Goal:** Your goal is to fill some cells in the grid with \"water\".\n3.  **Water Levels:** Within each tank, water must settle at a uniform level.

We need to place water uniformly while respecting these clues.\n  \n   - **Tank 3:** (Column 4)\n     - Row Clues: [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n     - This means one water cell in the first row of column 4, and no water in subsequent rows.\n\n2. **Filling Water Based on Constraints:**\n\n   - For **Tank 1 (Columns 0-1)**:\n     - Since row 0 has 0 water, both columns start empty.
