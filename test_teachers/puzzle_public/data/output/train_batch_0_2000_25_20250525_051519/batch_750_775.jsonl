{"question_id": "aquarium_562", "response": "To solve this Aquarium puzzle, we need to apply the rules methodically:\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n\n#### Step 1: Analyze the Rows and Columns Clues\n- Row clues (left side): [0, 1, 2, 6, 6, 6]\n- Column clues (top side): [5, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4]\n\n#### Step 2: Determine Water Levels for Each Tank\n- Tanks are defined by the red lines. The water must be uniform within each tank.\n\n#### Step 3: Fill the Cells Based on Clues\n\n##### Row 0\n- Clue: 0\n- No cells filled.\n\n##### Row 1\n- Clue: 1\n- Only one cell can be filled. It must be in the first column because other columns would violate the uniform water level rule within the tanks.\n\n##### Row 2\n- Clue: 2\n- Two cells must be filled. They must be in the first two columns due to the tank boundaries.\n\n##### Row 3 and Row 4\n- Clue: 6\n- All cells in these rows must be filled with water.\n\n##### Row 5\n- Clue: 6\n- All cells in this row must be filled with water except potentially in the second tank, where it can only go up to the height of the tank limit.\n\n#### Step 4: Verify Column Clues\n\n##### Column 0\n- Needs 5 filled cells.\n- Rows 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 have filled cells in this column.\n\n##### Column 1\n- Needs 3 filled cells.\n- Rows 2, 3, and 4 have filled cells in this column.\n\n##### Column 2\n- Needs 3 filled cells.\n- Rows 3, 4, and 5 have filled cells in this column.\n\n##### Column 3\n- Needs 3 filled cells.\n- Rows 3, 4, and 5 have filled cells in this column.\n\n##### Column 4\n- Needs 3 filled cells.\n- Rows 3, 4, and 5 have filled cells in this column.\n\n##### Column 5\n- Needs 4 filled cells.\n- Rows 2, 3, 4, and 5 have filled cells in this column.\n\n##### Conclusion\nBy checking all the clues and verifying the water levels within each tank, Option C matches the criteria set by the clues:\n\n```\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 0 0 1 0 0\n1 0 0 0 0 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1\n0 1 1 1 1 1\n```\n\nThus, the correct answer is \\boxed{C}.", "ground_truth": "A", "prompt": "You need to solve an Aquarium puzzle.\n\n**Aquarium Puzzle Rules:**\n1.  **The Grid:** The grid is divided into several regions called \"tanks\" by the thick colored (red) lines.\n2.  **The Goal:** Your goal is to fill some cells in the grid with \"water\".\n3.  **Water Levels:** Within each tank, water must settle at a uniform level.
