{"question_id": "aquarium_405", "response": "To solve this Aquarium puzzle, let's follow the rules and use the clues provided. We'll start by examining the grid and the numbers outside it.\n\n### Step-by-step Solution:\n\n#### Step 1: Analyze the clues:\n- Left-side row clues: 1, 2, 2, 4\n- Top-side column clues: 1, 1, 3, 4\n\n#### Step 2: Fill the grid according to the clues:\n\n**(a) Column 1 analysis:**\n- Clue = 1, so only one cell should have water in this column.\n- The only valid place for this water cell would be within the bottom-most tank (where the clue '4' is fully satisfied), because any water placed higher up would force more than 1 cell to be filled due to the water level settling rule.\n\n**(b) Column 2 analysis:**\n- Clue = 1, so only one cell should have water in this column.\n- The only valid place for this water cell would be within the bottom-most tank similarly as column 1.\n\n**(c) Column 3 analysis:**\n- Clue = 3, so three cells should have water in this column.\n- The top two tanks can only accommodate one cell each (because both have a size of 2 rows and water must settle uniformly). Thus, the remaining one cell will be in the bottom tank.\n\n**(d) Column 4 analysis:**\n- Clue = 4, so all four cells should have water in this column.\n- This implies all cells in this column must be filled.\n\n### Step 3: Final verification and matching to options:\nCombining these findings, here is the filled grid:\n```\n0 0 0 1\n0 0 1 1\n0 0 1 1\n1 1 1 1\n```\n\nThis matches exactly with Option D:\n```\n0 0 0 1\n0 0 1 1\n0 0 1 1\n1 1 1 1\n```\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\boxed{D}", "ground_truth": "D", "prompt": "You need to solve an Aquarium puzzle.\n\n**Aquarium Puzzle Rules:**\n1.  **The Grid:** The grid is divided into several regions called \"tanks\" by the thick colored (red) lines.\n2.  **The Goal:** Your goal is to fill some cells in the grid with \"water\".\n3.  **Water Levels:** Within each tank, water must settle at a uniform level. This means: if a cell is filled with water, all cells directly below it *within the same tank* must also be filled, down to the bottom of that tank.\n4.  **Clues:** The numbers outside the grid indicate how many cells *in total* must be filled with water in that specific row (numbers on the left) or column (numbers on the top).\n5.  **Solving:** Use the numbers as clues to figure out which cells must be filled with water, ensuring that the water level rule within each tank is followed, until all numbers are satisfied.\n\n\nYour task is to choose the correct grid configuration from the options below that represents the solution to the puzzle.

{"question_id": "kakuro_116", "response": "Let's approach this Kakuro puzzle methodically:\n\n### Analyzing the Clues:\n- The top row has three columns with a sum of 18.\n- The middle row has three columns with a sum of 10.\n- The bottom row has three columns with a sum of 23.\n\n### Analyzing the Columns:\n- The first column has rows adding up to 16.\n- The second column has rows adding up to 16.\n- The third column has rows adding up to 19.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n#### Top Row:\nThe top row needs three digits that add up to 18. Let's check possible combinations (no repeated digits):\n- Possible combinations: {9, 8, 1}, {9, 7, 2}, {9, 6, 3}, etc.\n  \n#### Middle Row:\nThe middle row needs three digits that add up to 10. Let's check possible combinations (no repeated digits):\n- Possible combinations: {9, 1, 0} isn't valid; {8, 1, 1} isn't valid; {7, 2, 1} could work.\n\n#### Bottom Row:\nThe bottom row needs three digits that add up to 23. Let's check possible combinations (no repeated digits):\n- Possible combinations: {9, 8, 6}, {9, 7, 7} isn't valid, {9, 6, 8} works.\n\n#### First Column:\nSum = 16. Possible combinations should align with above results.\n- If we assume 9 in the first position of top row; then possibilities fit well.\n\n#### Second Column:\nSum = 16. Possible combinations should align.\n- 1 + 7 + 8 fits well.\n\n#### Third Column:\nSum = 19. Possible combinations should align.\n- 9 + 8 + 6 fits well.\n\n### Verifying Against Options:\n\nOption A violates no repetition rule in columns/rows.\nOption B fits values well:\nTop row: 2 + 4 + 9 = 15 (not 18)\nMiddle row: 7 + 1 + 8 = 16 (correct)\nBottom row: 9 + 4 + 6 = 19 (not 23)\n\nChecking - Option C fits correctly:\nTop row: 2 + 5 + 9 = 16 (not 18)\nMiddle row: 7 + 1 + 8 = 16 (correct)\nBottom row: 9 + 4 + 6 = 19 \n\nOption D:\nTop row: 8 + 5 + 9 = 22\n\nThus final match is Option C.\n\n\\boxed{C}\n", "ground_truth": "C", "prompt": "You need to solve a 3x3 Kakuro puzzle.\n\n**Kakuro Puzzle Rules (3x3 Grid):**\n1. **Grid:** The grid is a 3x3 square, containing blank cells and clue cells.\n2. **Objective:** Fill all blank cells with numbers from 1 to 9.\n3. **Constraints:** Each digit (1 to 9) must satisfy the following conditions:\n    a.
