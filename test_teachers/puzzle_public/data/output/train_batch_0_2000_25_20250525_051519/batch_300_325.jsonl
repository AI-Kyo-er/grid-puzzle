The only combination that fits without repeating any numbers is `[9, 8]`, but since there’s no `9` or `8` in the first column clue `9`, this narrows down to `[8, 9]` not viable.

Possible pairs are `[1, 5]` and `[2, 4]`.\n- Considering across the rows, if `1` is placed in the first row, it conflicts with other clues.\n\n##### Third Column '20'\n- The third column requires two cells adding up to `20`. The only combination fitting this is `[9, 11]` but since max is `9`, it’s `[9, 8]`.\n\n##### Leftmost Column '9'\n- First cell is `3`, otherwise combinations like `[1, 8], [2, 7], [4, 5]` will fail in subsequent checks.\n\n##### Second Row '17'\n- We check feasible sums meeting horizontal and vertical checks.

{"question_id": "binairo_1437", "response": "To solve the given Binairo puzzle, we need to follow the rules carefully and place 0s and 1s in the empty cells accordingly. Let's start with the given clues and fill in the rest of the grid step by step.\n\nThe given clues are:\n- The bottom-left corner has two 0s vertically.\n- The top-right corner has one 1 horizontally.\n\nWe will use these clues to deduce the rest of the grid.\n\n1. **Fill in the known values:**\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}\n\\hline\n &  &  &  \\\\\n\\hline\n &  &  & 1 \\\\\n\\hline\n0 & 0 &  &  \\\\\n\\hline\n0 & 0 &  &  \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\n2. **Apply Rule 2 (no more than two consecutive identical numbers):**\n\nIn the third row, since there are already two 0s, the next two cells must be 1s.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}\n\\hline\n &  &  &  \\\\\n\\hline\n &  &  & 1 \\\\\n\\hline\n0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n\\hline\n0 & 0 &  &  \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\n3. **Apply Rule 3 (equal number of 0s and 1s per row/column):**\n\nIn the fourth row, we already have two 0s. To balance it out, the remaining two cells must be 1s.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}\n\\hline\n &  &  &  \\\\\n\\hline\n &  &  & 1 \\\\\n\\hline\n0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n\\hline\n0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nHowever, this violates Rule 4 (no two rows can be identical). So, we need to adjust the fourth row. Let's try placing a 1 and a 0 alternately to ensure uniqueness.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}\n\\hline\n &  &  &  \\\\\n\\hline\n &  &  & 1 \\\\\n\\hline\n0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n\\hline\n0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\n4. **Now fill in the first two rows:**\n\nFirst row needs two 1s and two 0s such that no three consecutive numbers are the same and it should not be identical to any other row. Let's try:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}\n\\hline\n1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n\\hline\n &  &  & 1 \\\\\n\\hline\n0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n\\hline\n0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nSecond row needs two 1s and two 0s, and it should satisfy all rules. Let's try:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}\n\\hline\n1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n\\hline\n1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n\\hline\n0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n\\hline\n0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThis satisfies all the rules.
