{"question_id": "aquarium_185", "response": "To solve this Aquarium puzzle, we'll follow the given rules and the clues provided for each row and column. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n\n#### Step 1: Analyze the tanks and the clues\nWe have four rows and four columns with the following clues:\n- Rows: 1, 1, 3, 4 (left side)\n- Columns: 2, 2, 1, 4 (top)\n\nThe grid is divided into tanks by the red lines. There are four tanks in this puzzle.\n\n#### Step 2: Fill in the cells according to the rules and clues\n\n**Row 1:** Needs 1 water cell.\n- The only possible place to put one water cell without violating any other clue is the last column (Column 4). Thus, Row 1, Column 4 must be filled with water.\n\n```plaintext\n0 0 0 1\n```\n\n**Row 2:** Needs 1 water cell.\n- Row 2 spans the first three columns because the tank boundary is after the third column. The only valid place to put one water cell here is also in the last column (Column 4), similar to Row 1.\n\n```plaintext\n0 0 0 1\n```\n\n**Row 3:** Needs 3 water cells.\n- This row spans all four columns. Since it needs 3 water cells and must respect the water level rule, the only valid configuration is:\n\n```plaintext\n1 1 0 1\n```\n\n**Row 4:** Needs 4 water cells.\n- This row spans all four columns. Since all cells must be filled with water to satisfy the row clue:\n\n```plaintext\n1 1 1 1\n```\n\n#### Step 3: Verify the solution against the column clues\n\n- **Column 1:** Needs 2 water cells. From our configuration, there are water cells in Row 3 and Row 4.\n- **Column 2:** Needs 2 water cells. Water cells are in Row 3 and Row 4.\n- **Column 3:** Needs 1 water cell. Water cell is in Row 4.\n- **Column 4:** Needs 4 water cells.

This is because the sum of the first 3 rows' clues (3+3+3=9) is less than the required 6 filled cells. So, the first 3 rows in column 1 are filled and the next two rows in column 1 and one row in column 2 will also be filled.\n   \n   - **Tank 2 (Columns 3 and 4):**\n     - Total cells filled = 1 + 5 = 6 out of 10 cells.\n     - Column 3 needs 1 filled cell.\n     - Column 4 needs 5 filled cells.\n     - The only way to satisfy the water level condition is to fill the last row in column 3 and the last 3 rows in column 4.\n   \n   - **Tank 3 (Column 5):**\n     - Total cells filled = 5 out of 5 cells.\n     - All 5 cells in column 5 need to be filled since the water level must be uniform.\n\n3. **Construct the Grid Based on Deduced Water Levels:**\n\n   - Row 1: [1, 0, 0, 1, 1] (3 cells filled)\n   - Row 2: [1, 0, 0, 1, 1] (3 cells filled)\n   - Row 3: [1, 0, 0, 1, 1] (3 cells filled)\n   - Row 4: [1, 0, 0, 1, 1] (3 cells filled)\n   - Row 5: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] (5 cells filled)\n\n4. **Match the Constructed Grid with Given Options:**\n\n   - Option A does not match because columns 3 and 4 do not have the correct water levels.\n   - Option B does not match because column 4 has incorrect water distribution.\n   - Option C matches perfectly with the constructed grid.\n   - Option D does not match because column 4 has incorrect water distribution.\n\nThus, the correct configuration is:\n\n\\boxed{C}", "ground_truth": "C", "prompt": "You need to solve an Aquarium puzzle.\n\n**Aquarium Puzzle Rules:**\n1.  **The Grid:** The grid is divided into several regions called \"tanks\" by the thick colored (red) lines.\n2.  **The Goal:** Your goal is to fill some cells in the grid with \"water\".\n3.  **Water Levels:** Within each tank, water must settle at a uniform level.
