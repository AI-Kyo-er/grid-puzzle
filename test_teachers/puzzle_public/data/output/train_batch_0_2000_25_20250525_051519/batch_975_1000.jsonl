This means there are 2 cells filled with water in this row.\n- Row 2 has a clue '3'. This means there are 3 cells filled with water in this row.\n- Row 3 has a clue '3'.

Each cell is represented by 0 (empty) or 1 (water).\n\nOption A:\n```\n1 0 0 0 1 1\n0 0 0 1 1 1\n1 1 0 0 1 1\n1 1 0 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1\n```\n\nOption B:\n```\n0 0 0 0 1 1\n0 0 0 1 1 1\n1 1 0 1 1 1\n1 1 0 1 1 1\n1 1 1 0 1 1\n1 0 1 1 1 1\n```\n\nOption C:\n```\n0 0 0 0 1 1\n0 0 0 1 1 1\n1 1 0 1 1 1\n1 1 0 0 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1\n```\n\nOption D:\n```\n0 0 0 0 1 1\n0 0 0 1 1 1\n1 1 0 1 1 1\n1 1 0 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1\n```\n\nPlease provide your answer as a single letter (A, B, C, or D) in \\boxed{} corresponding to the correct option.\nLet's think step by step:\n\n                                1.
