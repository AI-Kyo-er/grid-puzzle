{"question_id": "aquarium_441", "response": "To solve this Aquarium puzzle, let's break it down step-by-step using the given clues and rules.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n\n#### Step 1: Understand the Tanks\nThere are two tanks in this puzzle, separated by the red lines:\n1. The large tank on the left, consisting of 5 columns and 5 rows.\n2. The small tank on the right, consisting of 2 columns and 5 rows.\n\n#### Step 2: Analyze Row Clues\n1. The first row has a clue \"2\". In the larger tank, the red line splits the first row into two segments of length 2. Hence, both cells in the first segment must be filled with water.\n   \n   ```\n   1 1 x x x | x x\n   ```\n\n2. The second row has a clue \"2\". Similarly, both cells in the first segment of the larger tank must be filled.\n   \n   ```\n   1 1 x x x | x x\n   ```\n\n3. The third row has a clue \"2\". Again, both cells in the first segment must be filled.\n   \n   ```\n   1 1 x x x | x x\n   ```\n\n4. The fourth row has a clue \"2\". Both cells in the first segment must be filled.\n   \n   ```\n   1 1 x x x | x x\n   ```\n\n5. The fifth row has a clue \"3\". Here, we have three cells to fill within the larger tank. They must be filled completely up to the third cell.\n   \n   ```\n   1 1 1 x x | x x\n   ```\n\n#### Step 3: Analyze Column Clues\n1. The first column has a clue \"5\". All five cells in this column must be filled with water.\n   \n   ```\n   1 1 x x x | x x\n   1 1 x x x | x x\n   1 1 x x x | x x\n   1 1 x x x | x x\n   1 1 1 x x | x x\n   ```\n\n2.

The third column has a clue \"1\". Only one cell in this column must be filled, but due to the water settlement rule, it must be the bottommost cell.\n   \n   ```\n   1 1 0 x x | x x\n   1 1 0 x x | x x\n   1 1 0 x x | x x\n   1 1 0 x x | x x\n   1 1 1 x x | x x\n   ```\n\n#### Step 4: Check Small Tank\nThe smaller tank on the right side has no clues that would require any cells to be filled.

First, analyze the puzzle type and understand the rules.\n\n                                2. Examine the given constraints and initial conditions.\n\n                                3. Apply logical reasoning to solve the puzzle.\n\n                                4. Verify your solution against all rules.\n\n                                5. Finally, provide your answer.\n\n                                ", "image_file": "kakuro_207.png", "success": true}
