Initial Setup\nThe grid is divided into tanks by red lines, and the numbers outside the grid give us the number of filled cells per row and column.\n\n#### 2. Analyzing Clues\n\n##### Column Clues (Top Numbers)\n- Column 1: 3 filled cells\n- Column 2: 3 filled cells\n- Column 3: 3 filled cells\n- Column 4: 2 filled cells\n- Column 5: 3 filled cells\n- Column 6: 4 filled cells\n\n##### Row Clues (Left Numbers)\n- Row 1: 0 filled cells\n- Row 2: 0 filled cells\n- Row 3: 1 filled cell\n- Row 4: 5 filled cells\n- Row 5: 6 filled cells\n- Row 6: 6 filled cells\n\n#### 3. Filling the Grid Based on Clues\n\n##### Row 1 and Row 2\nBoth rows have a clue of 0 filled cells, so they should all be empty.\n\n```\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n```\n\n##### Row 3\nThis row has a clue of 1 filled cell.

We will fill these rows while keeping the water level rule in mind.\n\n- Row 4 needs 5 filled cells. The first four cells cannot be filled since there's a tank boundary that allows only one filled cell per section. The correct filling would be:\n\n```\n1 1 1 0 1 1\n```\n\n- Rows 5 and 6 need all 6 cells filled since the entire row is a single tank.\n\n```\n1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1\n```\n\nCombining all the above steps, our filled grid looks like:\n\n```\n0 0 0 0 0 0          (Row 1)\n0 0 0 0 0 0          (Row 2)\n0 0 0 0 0 1          (Row 3)\n1 1 1 0 1 1          (Row 4)\n1 1 1 1 1 1          (Row 5)\n1 1 1 1 1 1          (Row 6)\n```\n\n#### 4.
