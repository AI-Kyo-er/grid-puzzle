{"question_id": "aquarium_108", "response": "To solve this Aquarium puzzle, we'll examine how the water levels should be set based on the provided clues.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n#### Step 1: Analyze the Tanks\nThe grid is divided into tanks by the thick red lines. There are two horizontal tanks and one vertical tank. Let's label them for clarity:\n- Left vertical tank: 4 rows high\n- Top right horizontal tank: 3 columns wide\n- Bottom right horizontal tank: 3 columns wide\n\n#### Step 2: Examine Row Clues\n- The first three rows have a clue of '1', meaning only one cell should be filled in each of these rows.\n- The last row has a clue of '4', meaning all four cells should be filled in this row.\n\n#### Step 3: Examine Column Clues\n- The first column has a clue of '1', meaning only one cell should be filled in this column.\n- The next three columns each have a clue of '1', meaning only one cell should be filled in each of these columns.\n\n#### Step 4: Apply Water Level Rule\nSince the water must fill uniformly within each tank, and considering the row/column clues:\n\n1. In the left vertical tank (4 rows), only one cell can be filled per row, so the filled cell must be at the bottom (last row). Thus, the bottom-left cell will be filled with water.\n2. The rest of the left vertical tank will remain empty except for the bottom cell.\n\n3. For the top horizontal tank (3 columns):\n   - Only one cell in each column can be filled.\n   - Since the last column already has its bottom cell filled (from the previous step), it cannot be filled again.\n   - Thus, either the middle or the first cell of the second column can be filled (it doesn’t matter since it will eventually be clear).\n\n4. For the bottom horizontal tank (3 columns):\n   - All cells must be filled due to the row clue of '4'.\n\n#### Step 5: Check Options Against Solution\nNow let’s check each option against our derived solution:\n\n**Option A:**\n```\n1 0 0 0\n1 0 0 0\n1 0 0 0\n1 1 1 1\n```\nThis fits the constraints perfectly.
