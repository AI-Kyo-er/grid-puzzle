To avoid three consecutive ones at the end, the second and third positions should be '0' and '1' respectively.\n- Now it looks like `1 0 _ 0`. The third position must be '1' to satisfy the rule of having an equal number of 0s and 1s.\n- Thus, Row 2 becomes `1 0 1 0`.\n\n#### Row 3:\n- The middle has '0', and ends with '0'. So, the first two positions must be '1' and '0' respectively.\n- Thus, Row 3 becomes `1 0 0 0`.\n\n#### Row 4:\n- The middle has '0'.
