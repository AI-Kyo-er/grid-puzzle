{"question_id": "aquarium_182", "response": "Here's a step-by-step approach to solving this Aquarium puzzle based on the provided rules and constraints:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Tank Constraints\n\nEach tank needs uniformly filled water levels. The tanks are separated by red lines. We have 3 tanks here:\n\n- Top-left tank: 3 columns by 3 rows.\n- Middle-right tank: 2 columns by 3 rows.\n- Bottom-left tank: 2 columns by 2 rows.\n\n### Step 2: Examine the Row and Column Clues\n\nNumbers on the left indicate the number of water cells per row:\n\n- Row 1: 0 water cells.\n- Row 2: 0 water cells.\n- Row 3: 1 water cell.\n- Row 4: 3 water cells.\n- Row 5: 3 water cells.\n\nNumbers on the top indicate the number of water cells per column:\n\n- Column 1: 2 water cells.\n- Column 2: 2 water cells.\n- Column 3: 3 water cells.\n- Column 4: 0 water cells.\n- Column 5: 0 water cells.\n\n### Step 3: Fill the Grid Based on Constraints\n\n#### Row 1 and Row 2:\nSince both rows have 0 water cells, we can mark them as empty.\n\n```\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n? ? ? ? ?\n? ? ? ? ?\n? ? ? ? ?\n```\n\n#### Row 3:\nRow 3 has 1 water cell. It should be placed in the leftmost column where it fits the column clues. Both the first two columns can fit one water cell as their column clue is 2. However, placing it in the third column doesn't satisfy any column’s requirement since it already has a 3 in the column. So let's place it in the second column.\n\n```\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 1 ? ? ?\n? ? ? ? ?\n? ? ? ? ?\n```\n\n#### Row 4 and Row 5:\nBoth Rows 4 and 5 require 3 water cells, and they belong to different tanks. Since the bottom tank only has 2 columns and 2 rows, it must be completely filled up.\n\n```\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 1 ? ? ?\n1 1 1 0 0\n1 1 1 0 0\n```\n\n#### Column 3:\nColumn 3 requires 3 water cells.
