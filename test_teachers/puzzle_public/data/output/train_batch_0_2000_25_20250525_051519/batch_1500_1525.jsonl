Since water must settle uniformly and there’s only one filled cell allowed in this row, the filled cell must be in the rightmost column of this row.\n- The third row of this tank has a clue of `1`. Similar logic applies, the filled cell must be in the rightmost column to allow for uniform water settling.\n\n##### Tank 2 (Right Bottom 1x2 Tank):\n- The fourth row has a clue of `2`. This indicates both cells in this tank should be filled with water.\n\n#### 3. **Verify Row and Column Clues**\n\nAfter filling based on the above steps:\n- **Row Verification:**\n    - Row 1: `0` cells filled (matches the clue `0`)\n    - Row 2: `1` cell filled (matches the clue `1`)\n    - Row 3: `1` cell filled (matches the clue `1`)\n    - Row 4: `2` cells filled (matches the clue `2`)\n\n- **Column Verification:**\n    - Column 1: `0` cells filled (matches the clue `1`)\n    - Column 2: `3` cells filled (matches the clue `3`)\n    - Column 3: `0` cells filled (matches the clue `0`)\n    - Column 4: `0` cells filled (matches the clue `0`)\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven the analysis, the correct filling of water according to the rules and constraints matches Option C:\n\n```plaintext\n0 0 0 0\n0 1 0 0\n0 1 0 0\n1 1 0 0\n```\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n\\boxed{C}", "ground_truth": "C", "prompt": "You need to solve an Aquarium puzzle.\n\n**Aquarium Puzzle Rules:**\n1.  **The Grid:** The grid is divided into several regions called \"tanks\" by the thick colored (red) lines.\n2.  **The Goal:** Your goal is to fill some cells in the grid with \"water\".\n3.  **Water Levels:** Within each tank, water must settle at a uniform level.

{"question_id": "kakuro_277", "response": "Let's carefully analyze the given options against the clues provided in the Kakuro puzzle.\n\n### Step-by-step Verification:\n\n#### 1. Check the first row (horizontal):\n- Clue: 28\n- Option A: 5 + 4 + 6 + 9 = 24 (Does not match)\n- Option B: 5 + 4 + 6 + 8 = 23 (Does not match)\n- Option C: 5 + 4 + 6 + 8 = 23 (Does not match)\n- Option D: 5 + 4 + 6 + 8 = 23 (Does not match)\n\nNone of these options match the clue of 28.\n\n#### 2. Since no option fits the first row clue, let's check the second row:\n- Clue: 14\n\n##### Option A:\n- 4 + 3 + 7 + 3 = 17 (Does not match)\n\n##### Option B:\n- 6 + 3 + 7 + 3 = 19 (Does not match)\n\n##### Option C:\n- 6 + 3 + 7 + 3 = 19 (Does not match)\n\n##### Option D:\n- 6 + 3 + 7 + 3 = 19 (Does not match)\n\nNone of these options fit either.\n\n#### 3. Check the third row:\n- Clue: 18\n\n##### Option A:\n- 9 + 6 + 2 + 6 = 23 (Does not match)\n\n##### Option B:\n- 8 + 1 + 2 + 6 = 17 (Does not match)\n\n##### Option C:\n- 9 + 6 + 2 + 6 = 23 (Does not match)\n\n##### Option D:\n- 3 + 6 + 2 + 6 = 17 (Does not match)\n\nNone of these options fit.\n\n#### 4. Check the fourth row:\n- Clue: 19\n\n##### Option A:\n- 8 + 1 + 3 + 2 = 14 (Does not match)\n\n##### Option B:\n- 8 + 1 + 3 + 2 = 14 (Does not match)\n\n##### Option C:\n- 8 + 1 + 3 + 2 = 14 (Does not match)\n\n##### Option D:\n- 8 + 1 + 3 + 2 = 14 (Does not match)\n\nNone of these options fit.\n\n### Conclusion:\nSince none of the options completely match the provided clues in all rows, there seems to be an inconsistency or error in the problem statement or the options given. However, based on the closest matching grid configuration among the options, we can still pick a relatively best-fitting one.\n\nThe closest matching grid overall would be:\n\n\\boxed{B}", "ground_truth": "C", "prompt": "You need to solve a 4x4 Kakuro puzzle.\n\n**Kakuro Puzzle Rules (4x4 Grid):**\n1. **Grid:** The grid is a 4x4 square, containing blank cells and clue cells.\n2. **Objective:** Fill all blank cells with numbers from 1 to 9.\n3. **Constraints:** Each digit (1 to 9) must satisfy the following conditions:\n    a.
