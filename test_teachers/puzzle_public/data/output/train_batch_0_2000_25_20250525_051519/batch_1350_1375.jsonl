{"question_id": "binairo_1048", "response": "Here's the step-by-step reasoning for solving this Binairo puzzle:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the given puzzle grid\n\nWe know the following:\n- The red boxes represent '1'.\n- The blue boxes represent '0'.\n- The grid is partially filled already with four '1's and three '0's.\n\n### Step 2: Apply the rules of Binairo\n\n#### Rule 1: Each cell must be either '0' or '1'\nThis rule is already being followed since the grid only contains '0's and '1's.\n\n#### Rule 2: No more than two consecutive identical numbers in a row/column\nCheck existing sequences:\n- Top row: `...1` (remaining cells cannot have two consecutive '1's)\n- Second row: `01..` (remaining cells cannot have two consecutive '1's)\n- Third row: `..0.` (remaining cells cannot have two consecutive '0's)\n- Fourth row: `0..1` (remaining cells cannot have two consecutive '0's)\n\n#### Rule 3: Equal number of '0's and '1's per row/column\nCurrently, there are 4 '1's and 3 '0's. The puzzle needs one more '0'.\n\n#### Rule 4: No two rows/columns can be identical\nMake sure we don't repeat any sequence when filling out the grid.\n\n### Step 3: Fill in the grid logically\n\nLet's start filling:\n- **Top row**: `...1` needs to be `1001` to avoid 3 '0's or 3 '1's.\n- **Second row**: `01..` needs to be `0110` to avoid 3 '1's or 3 '0's.\n- **Third row**: `..0.` needs to be `1100` to avoid 3 '0's or 3 '1's.\n- **Fourth row**: `0..1` needs to be `0011` \n\nSo our filled grid should be:\n```\n1 0 0 1\n0 1 1 0\n1 1 0 0\n0 0 1 1\n```\n\n### Step 4: Verification\n\nVerify each row and column:\n- Rows: `1001`, `0110`, `1100`, `0011` - All unique.\n- Columns: `1010`, `0110`, `0101`, `1001` - All unique.\n\nEach condition of the Binairo puzzle is satisfied.\n\n### Step 5: Match with provided options\n\nOption A matches perfectly with our grid:\n```\n1 0 0 1\n0 1 1 0\n1 1 0 0\n0 0 1 1\n```\n\nThus, the correct option is \\boxed{A}.", "ground_truth": "A", "prompt": "You need to solve a Binairo puzzle.\n\n**Binairo Puzzle Rules:**\n1.
