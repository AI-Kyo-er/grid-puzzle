{"question_id": "aquarium_556", "response": "To solve this Aquarium puzzle, we will follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Tanks and Constraints\n- There are two tanks created by the red lines.\n- The first tank spans columns 1-3 and rows 1-5.\n- The second tank spans columns 4-5 and rows 1-5.\n- Row clues are: [1, 1, 1, 2, 2]\n- Column clues are: [0, 0, 0, 5, 2]\n\n### Step 2: Fill the Second Tank\n- For column 4, the clue is 5, meaning all five cells must be filled with water.\n- For column 5, the clue is 2, meaning the bottom two cells must be filled with water (due to water settling uniformly).\n\nThis gives us:\n\n```\n? ? ? 1 0\n? ? ? 1 0\n? ? ? 1 0\n? ? ? 1 1\n? ? ? 1 1\n```\n\n### Step 3: Fill the First Tank\n- We now look at the row clues for the first tank (columns 1-3):\n  - Row 1 has 1 filled cell, but none of these can be in the first tank since it would violate column 0 clues.\n  - Row 2 has 1 filled cell, again cannot be in the first tank.\n  - Row 3 has 1 filled cell, again cannot be in the first tank.\n  - Rows 4 and 5 have 2 filled cells each, but these must be in the second tank.\n\nSince there are no more constraints for the first tank based on the given clues, it remains empty:\n\n```\n0 0 0 1 0\n0 0 0 1 0\n0 0 0 1 0\n0 0 0 1 1\n0 0 0 1 1\n```\n\n### Step 4: Check All Clues and Options\n\n- Rows: \n  - Row 1: 1 filled (column 4)\n  - Row 2: 1 filled (column 4)\n  - Row 3: 1 filled (column 4)\n  - Row 4: 2 filled (columns 4 and 5)\n  - Row 5: 2 filled (columns 4 and 5)\n\n- Columns: \n  - Column 1: 0 filled\n  - Column 2: 0 filled\n  - Column 3: 0 filled\n  - Column 4: 5 filled\n  - Column 5: 2 filled\n\nAll clues match.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe correct grid configuration is Option B:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{B}\n\\]", "ground_truth": "B", "prompt": "You need to solve an Aquarium puzzle.\n\n**Aquarium Puzzle Rules:**\n1.  **The Grid:** The grid is divided into several regions called \"tanks\" by the thick colored (red) lines.\n2.  **The Goal:** Your goal is to fill some cells in the grid with \"water\".\n3.  **Water Levels:** Within each tank, water must settle at a uniform level. This means: if a cell is filled with water, all cells directly below it *within the same tank* must also be filled, down to the bottom of that tank.\n4.  **Clues:** The numbers outside the grid indicate how many cells *in total* must be filled with water in that specific row (numbers on the left) or column (numbers on the top).\n5.  **Solving:** Use the numbers as clues to figure out which cells must be filled with water, ensuring that the water level rule within each tank is followed, until all numbers are satisfied.\n\n\nYour task is to choose the correct grid configuration from the options below that represents the solution to the puzzle. Each cell is represented by 0 (empty) or 1 (water).\n\nOption A:\n```\n0 0 0 1 0\n0 0 0 1 0\n0 0 1 1 0\n0 0 0 1 1\n0 0 0 1 0\n```\n\nOption B:\n```\n0 0 0 1 0\n0 0 0 1 0\n0 0 0 1 0\n0 0 0 1 1\n0 0 0 1 1\n```\n\nOption C:\n```\n0 0 0 1 0\n0 0 0 1 0\n0 0 0 1 0\n0 0 0 1 0\n0 0 0 0 1\n```\n\nOption D:\n```\n0 0 0 1 0\n0 0 0 1 0\n0 0 0 1 0\n0 0 0 1 0\n0 0 0 1 1\n```\n\nPlease provide your answer as a single letter (A, B, C, or D) in \\boxed{} corresponding to the correct option.\nLet's think step by step:\n\n                                1.
