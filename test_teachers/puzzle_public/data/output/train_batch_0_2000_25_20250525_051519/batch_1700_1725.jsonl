{"question_id": "aquarium_237", "response": "To solve this Aquarium puzzle, let's break it down step-by-step using the provided clues and rules.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Tanks and Clues**\n\n- There are four tanks separated by red lines.\n- We have row clues: 0, 2, 4, 4 (from top to bottom).\n- We have column clues: 3, 2, 2, 3 (from left to right).\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Tanks\n\n#### Top Left Tank (4x2):\n- Row 1 clue is 0, so no water in this row.\n- Row 2 clue is 2, and the tank is 4 wide, so the water level cannot start here because it would not satisfy subsequent rows.\n\n#### Top Right Tank (2x2):\n- Row 1 clue is 0, so no water in this row.\n- Row 2 clue is 2, meaning both columns in this tank must have water up to at least this row.\n\n#### Bottom Left Tank (2x2):\n- Row 3 and Row 4 clues are both 4, implying water fills the entire tank from Row 3 to Row 4.\n\n#### Bottom Right Tank (2x2):\n- Row 3 and Row 4 clues are both 4, implying water fills the entire tank from Row 3 to Row 4.\n\n### Step 3: Fill the Water According to Row and Column Clues\n\n- For column 1, the clue is 3. Given the bottom two rows are fully filled, this column can only have one more cell filled in the second row.\n- For column 2, the clue is 2, so filling the second row satisfies this.\n- For column 3, the clue is 2, so filling the second row satisfies this.\n- For column 4, the clue is 3, meaning the bottom three rows should be filled.\n\nThus, the grid should look like:\n\n```\n0 0 0 0\n1 0 0 1\n1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1\n```\n\n### Step 4: Match with Options\n\nThis matches exactly with Option C.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\boxed{C}", "ground_truth": "C", "prompt": "You need to solve an Aquarium puzzle.\n\n**Aquarium Puzzle Rules:**\n1.  **The Grid:** The grid is divided into several regions called \"tanks\" by the thick colored (red) lines.\n2.  **The Goal:** Your goal is to fill some cells in the grid with \"water\".\n3.  **Water Levels:** Within each tank, water must settle at a uniform level.
