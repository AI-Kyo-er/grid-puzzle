There is only one tank in this row, so exactly one cell must be filled. It can either be the first cell (4th column) or the second cell (3rd column). \n\n2. **Row 2**: Has a clue of `2`. This row has two tanks. One tank spans columns 4 and 3, and the other spans columns 1 and 0. Therefore, both cells in the larger tank (columns 4 & 3) must be filled because they form a single continuous column.\n\n3. **Row 3**: Has a clue of `2`. This row also has two tanks, similar to Row 2, so both cells in the larger tank (columns 4 & 3) will be filled.\n\n4. **Row 4**: Has a clue of `3`. This row has three tanks. The leftmost tank spans columns 4, 3, and 2. Therefore, all three cells in this tank (columns 4, 3, and 2) will be filled.\n\n#### Column Analysis:\n- **Column 4**: Has a clue of `4`. The entire column must be filled since there are no breaks in the vertical direction.\n- **Column 3**: Has a clue of `3`. The entire column except for the top cell in the tank must be filled.\n- **Column 1**: Has a clue of `1`. Only the bottom cell in the tank can be filled.\n- **Column 0**: Has a clue of `0`. No cells in this column should be filled.\n\n### Filling the Grid:\nBased on the above analysis:\n- Row 1: [1, 1, 0, 0]\n- Row 2: [1, 1, 0, 1]\n- Row 3: [1, 1, 0, 0]\n- Row 4: [1, 1, 1, 0]\n\nThis matches Option B:\n```\n1 1 0 0\n1 1 0 1\n1 1 0 0\n1 1 1 0\n```\n\nThus, the correct option is \\boxed{B}.", "ground_truth": "D", "prompt": "You need to solve an Aquarium puzzle.\n\n**Aquarium Puzzle Rules:**\n1.  **The Grid:** The grid is divided into several regions called \"tanks\" by the thick colored (red) lines.\n2.  **The Goal:** Your goal is to fill some cells in the grid with \"water\".\n3.  **Water Levels:** Within each tank, water must settle at a uniform level.
