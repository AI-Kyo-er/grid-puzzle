{"question_id": "aquarium_39", "response": "To determine the correct solution for the Aquarium puzzle, we should thoroughly analyze the clues provided and apply the rules step by step.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n#### Step 1: Identify Tanks and Their Boundaries\nEach red line represents the boundary of a tank. We can see there are five tanks:\n1. Top-left 2x2 square\n2. Top-right 3x2 rectangle\n3. Middle 3x3 square\n4. Bottom-left 3x2 rectangle\n5. Bottom-right 2x3 rectangle\n\n#### Step 2: Analyze Row and Column Clues\n\n- **Row 0**: The clue \"0\" means no cells filled with water. Thus, all cells in this row should be empty.\n- **Row 1**: The clue \"0\" means no cells filled with water. Thus, all cells in this row should be empty.\n- **Row 2**: The clue \"0\" means no cells filled with water. Thus, all cells in this row should be empty.\n\nThese three rows will remain empty based on the clues.\n\n- **Row 3**: The clue \"3\" means three cells filled with water. Since this row spans only one tank (the middle 3x3 square), these three cells will occupy the leftmost three positions of this row.\n- **Row 4**: The clue \"6\" means six cells filled with water. This row spans two tanks (middle 3x3 and bottom-right 2x3). The middle 3x3 tank can accommodate up to 3 more cells, the rest must fill in the bottom-right tank.\n- **Row 5**: The clue \"6\" means six cells filled with water. Similar to row 4, all six cells must be filled across the bottom-left and bottom-right tanks.\n\n#### Step 3: Check Column Constraints\n\n- **Column 0**: The clue \"3\" means three cells filled with water. These three cells will be in rows 3, 4, and 5 as they belong to the bottom-left 3x2 and middle 3x3 tanks.\n- **Column 1**: The clue \"3\" means three cells filled with water. These three cells will be in rows 3, 4, and 5 as they belong to the bottom-left 3x2 and middle 3x3 tanks.\n- **Column 2**: The clue \"2\" means two cells filled with water. These two cells will be in rows 4 and 5 as they belong to the bottom-left 3x2 and middle 3x3 tanks.\n- **Column 3**: The clue \"2\" means two cells filled with water. These two cells will be in rows 4 and 5 as they belong to the middle 3x3 and bottom-right 2x3 tanks.\n- **Column 4**: The clue \"3\" means three cells filled with water. These three cells will be in rows 3, 4, and 5 as they belong to the middle 3x3 and bottom-right 2x3 tanks.\n- **Column 5**: The clue \"2\" means two cells filled with water. These two cells will be in rows 3 and 4 as they belong to the top-right 3x2 and bottom-right 2x3 tanks.\n\n#### Step 4: Match the Solution with Options\n\nBased on the above analysis, Option A matches all the constraints and rules perfectly:\n```\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 1 0 0 0 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1\n```\nThis configuration ensures all row and column clues are satisfied with proper water levels in each tank.\n\nFinal Answer: \\boxed{A}", "ground_truth": "A", "prompt": "You need to solve an Aquarium puzzle.\n\n**Aquarium Puzzle Rules:**\n1.  **The Grid:** The grid is divided into several regions called \"tanks\" by the thick colored (red) lines.\n2.  **The Goal:** Your goal is to fill some cells in the grid with \"water\".\n3.  **Water Levels:** Within each tank, water must settle at a uniform level.

Applying Water Level Rule and Filling Cells:\n\n- **Row 0, Row 1, Row 2**: These rows must have no water since their clue is 0.\n  \n- **Row 3**: Needs 3 water cells. The only possible way to place 3 water cells while maintaining uniform level inside the tanks is:\n  ```\n  Row 3: 0 1 1 1 0 0\n  ```\n\n- **Row 4**: Needs 4 water cells. Placing these while maintaining uniform levels inside the tanks can be:\n  ```\n  Row 4: 1 1 1 1 0 0\n  ```\n\n- **Row 5**: Needs all 6 water cells. Therefore,\n  ```\n  Row 5: 1 1 1 1 1 1\n  ```\n\n#### 3. Verify Columns:\n- **Column 0**: Must have 2 water cells. From our filling, it has two water cells (row 4 and row 5), so this is correct.\n- **Column 1**: Must have 3 water cells. From our filling, it has three water cells (row 3, row 4, and row 5), so this is correct.\n- **Column 2**: Must have 3 water cells. From our filling, it has three water cells (row 3, row 4, and row 5), so this is correct.\n- **Column 3**: Must have 3 water cells. From our filling, it has three water cells (row 3, row 4, and row 5), so this is correct.\n- **Column 4**: Must have 1 water cell. From our filling, it has one water cell (row 5), so this is correct.\n- **Column 5**: Must have 1 water cell.
