{"question_id": "aquarium_319", "response": "To solve this Aquarium puzzle, we'll use the given clues for rows and columns while adhering to the water level rule in each tank. Let's break down the process step-by-step:\n\n1. **Analyze Clues and Tanks:**\n   - Column clues: 3, 4, 2, 2, 2, 2\n   - Row clues: 0, 0, 1, 2, 6, 6\n\n2. **Start with the Easiest Clues:**\n\n   - **Row 1 & Row 2 (both have clue '0'):**\n     These rows should have no water. So mark all cells in these rows as empty.\n\n   - **Column 2 (clue '4'):**\n     There are two tanks in this column. The bottom tank has only one cell, and the top tank has four cells. To meet the requirement of 4 filled cells, all four cells in the top tank must be filled. \n\n3. **Adjust Based on Filled Cells:**\n\n   - Now that we have filled the first four cells in column 2, we can proceed to the next steps.\n\n   - **Column 1 (clue '3'):**\n     There are three cells in the bottom tank of this column. All three must be filled to satisfy the clue 3.\n\n   - **Column 3 (clue '2'):**\n     There are two tanks here. The bottom tank already has two empty cells (due to the other filled tanks). Therefore, the top two cells in the middle tank must be filled.\n\n4. **Check Remaining Clues:**\n\n   - **Column 4, 5, and 6 (all have clue '2'):**\n     Check for consistent filling based on previously filled cells and tank boundaries.\n\n   - **Rows 3, 4, 5, and 6:**\n     Ensure the row clues match after filling the column clues.\n\nAfter applying these steps, the correct configuration matching all rules and clues is Option D:\n\n```\n0 0 0 0 0 0 \n0 0 0 0 0 0 \n0 1 0 0 0 0 \n1 1 0 0 0 0 \n1 1 1 1 1 1 \n1 1 1 1 1 1 \n```\n\nThus, the final answer is \\boxed{D}.", "ground_truth": "D", "prompt": "You need to solve an Aquarium puzzle.\n\n**Aquarium Puzzle Rules:**\n1.  **The Grid:** The grid is divided into several regions called \"tanks\" by the thick colored (red) lines.\n2.  **The Goal:** Your goal is to fill some cells in the grid with \"water\".\n3.  **Water Levels:** Within each tank, water must settle at a uniform level.

Since there are two separate tanks in this row, only one of them can have water. The second tank (column 2) fits this clue better because filling the first tank would conflict with future rows needing more water.\n- **Row 2:** Needs 4 water cells. The rightmost tank has 3 cells within this row, so these must be filled, plus the remaining 1 will come from the leftmost tank.\n- **Row 4:** Needs 6 water cells. All six cells must be filled.\n- **Row 5:** Needs 6 water cells. All six cells must be filled.\n\n### Column Analysis:\n\n- **Column 0:** Needs 4 water cells. Based on rows, the water starts from Row 2 and goes down.\n- **Column 1:** Needs 4 water cells. Based on rows, the water starts from Row 2 and goes down.\n- **Column 2:** Needs 5 water cells.
