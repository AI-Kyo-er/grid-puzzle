{"question_id": "aquarium_106", "response": "To determine the correct solution for this Aquarium puzzle, let’s examine each constraint and clue systematically.\n\n### Step-by-step solution\n\n#### 1. Analyze rows and columns with exact cell counts:\n\n- Look at Column 5 with clue 5. This indicates that all 5 cells in Column 5 should be filled with water. Thus, Option B can be eliminated since it doesn’t fully fill Column 5.\n\n#### 2. Examine the tanks:\n\n- The grid is divided into two vertical tanks by the red line. \n  - Left tank spans columns 1 to 3.\n  - Right tank spans columns 4 to 5.\n\n#### 3. Check row clues individually:\n\n- Row 1 has a clue 1. The only way to satisfy this is to have 1 cell filled under Column 5 because it’s part of the right tank, which needs to be filled uniformly.\n\n- Row 2 also has a clue 1. Similar logic applies; the only way is to fill the single cell under Column 5.\n\n- Row 3 has a clue 1. Again, the only way is to fill the single cell under Column 5.\n\n- Row 4 has a clue 2. With the right tank filled according to previous steps, we know that these two cells must be filled in Column 4 and 5. \n\n- Row 5 has a clue 2. Since Column 5 is already filled up, Column 4 must also be filled up to maintain uniformity in the right tank.\n\n#### 4. Cross-check the column clues:\n\n- Column 1 to 3 have all clues 0. Therefore, they remain empty.\n\n- Column 4 has a clue 2, and indeed, the last two cells are filled with water as required.\n\n- Column 5 has a clue 5, and all five cells are filled correctly.\n\n#### Concluding step:\n\nBy comparing the analyzed results with the provided options:\n\n- Option A fits all the constraints perfectly.\n\nThus, the correct answer is \\boxed{A}.", "ground_truth": "D", "prompt": "You need to solve an Aquarium puzzle.\n\n**Aquarium Puzzle Rules:**\n1.  **The Grid:** The grid is divided into several regions called \"tanks\" by the thick colored (red) lines.\n2.  **The Goal:** Your goal is to fill some cells in the grid with \"water\".\n3.  **Water Levels:** Within each tank, water must settle at a uniform level.

Since Column 1 already has water in these rows, no other columns can have water in these rows (because the tank water level must be uniform within a row). \n   - Row 1, Columns 2-4 = 0\n   - Row 2, Columns 2-4 = 0\n\n3. **Row 3 and Row 4**: Both have a clue of 4. Given the tanks, Row 3 spans from Column 1 to Column 4, so all these cells should be filled with water:\n   - Row 3, Columns 1-4 = 1\n\n4. Looking at the remaining sections, particularly the tank starting at Row 4, Column 2:\n   - It needs to satisfy the remaining column clues.\n   - Column 2 needs 2 water cells, but one is already in Row 3.\n   - Therefore, Row 4, Column 2 = 1.\n\n   - Similarly, Column 3 and Column 4 need 2 water cells each, with one in Row 3.\n   - Therefore, Row 4, Columns 3 and 4 = 1.\n\n### Final Configuration\n\nUsing this analysis, our final grid should look like:\n\n```\n1 0 0 0\n1 0 0 0\n1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1\n```\n\nThis matches Option B.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{B}\n\\]", "ground_truth": "B", "prompt": "You need to solve an Aquarium puzzle.\n\n**Aquarium Puzzle Rules:**\n1.  **The Grid:** The grid is divided into several regions called \"tanks\" by the thick colored (red) lines.\n2.  **The Goal:** Your goal is to fill some cells in the grid with \"water\".\n3.  **Water Levels:** Within each tank, water must settle at a uniform level.
