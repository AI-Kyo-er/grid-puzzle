Analyze each provided option\n\nWe will check each option against the given non-empty cells and ensure that the numbers satisfy the Sudoku rules.\n\n#### Option A:\n- Check if the first row matches: `4 8 7 4 1 9 2 6 5` - It has two `4`s which violates the rule; thus, it can't be correct.\n\n#### Option B:\n- Check if the first row matches: `4 2 7 3 1 9 2 6 5` - It also has two `2`s, violating the rule; thus, it can't be correct.\n\n#### Option C:\n- Check the third row of the input: `2 9 3 6 5 8 7 4 1` \n- Compare it with Option C's third row: `2 9 3 8 5 8 4 4 1`. This row has two `8`s and two `4`s, thus violating the rule; thus, it can't be correct.\n\n#### Option D:\n- Check the first row: `4 8 7 3 1 9 2 6 5` - Matches the given starting digits perfectly.\n- Check other rows, columns, and 3x3 grids: They match all the given starting digits and follow the Sudoku rules without any repetition in rows, columns, or 3x3 grids.\n\n### Conclusion:\nSince only Option D satisfies all the Sudoku rules and matches the given starting digits, it is the correct solution.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{D}\n\\]", "ground_truth": "D", "prompt": "You need to solve a Sudoku puzzle of size 9x9.\n\n**Sudoku Puzzle Rules (9x9 grid):**\n1.  **The Grid:** The grid is a 9x9 square, further divided into each 3x3 subgrid (non-overlapping regions).\n2.  **The Goal:** Fill all empty cells in the grid with digits from 1 to 9.\n3.  **Constraints:** Each digit (1 to 9) must appear exactly once in:\n    a.
