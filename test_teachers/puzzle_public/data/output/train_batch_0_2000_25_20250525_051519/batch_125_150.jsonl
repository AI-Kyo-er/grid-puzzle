{"question_id": "binairo_407", "response": "To determine the correct grid configuration, let's follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the given puzzle\nThe binairo puzzle requires us to fill the grid with 0s and 1s while adhering to specific rules. The blue cells indicate 0s, and the white cells need to be filled with either 0 or 1 based on the rules.\n\n### Step 2: Apply the rules\n\n#### Rule 1: Each cell must contain either a 0 or a 1.\nThis rule is inherently followed since we only have binary choices.\n\n#### Rule 2: No more than two consecutive identical numbers in any row or column.\nFrom the given puzzle:\n- Top row: `0 1 1 _` - The last cell cannot be 1 (because there are already two consecutive 1s). So it must be 0.\n- Second row: All empty, but no two identical numbers consecutively.\n- Third row: `0 0 1 _` - The last cell cannot be 0 (because there are already two consecutive 0s). So it must be 1.\n- Fourth row: `0 1 1 _` - The last cell cannot be 1 (because there are already two consecutive 1s). So it must be 0.\n\nSo far, we have:\n```\n0 1 1 0\n_ _ _ _\n0 0 1 1\n0 1 1 0\n```\n\n#### Rule 3: Equal number of 0s and 1s in each row and column.\nWe check the count now. Each row should have exactly two 0s and two 1s.\n\n#### Rule 4: No two rows or columns can be identical.\nThe first and fourth rows are already identical (`0 1 1 0`). This violates rule 4. We need to adjust.\n\n### Step 3: Check given options\n\n**Option A:**\n```\n1 0 0 1\n1 1 0 0\n0 0 1 1\n0 1 1 0\n```\n- Rows analysis: \n  - Row 1: `1 0 0 1` (valid)\n  - Row 2: `1 1 0 0` (valid)\n  - Row 3: `0 0 1 1` (valid)\n  - Row 4: `0 1 1 0` (valid)\n- Columns analysis: \n  - Column 1: `1 1 0 0` (valid)\n  - Column 2: `0 1 0 1` (valid)\n  - Column 3: `0 0 1 1` (valid)\n  - Column 4: `1 0 1 0` (valid)\n\nAll rules are satisfied.\n\n**Option B:**\n```\n0 0 0 1\n1 1 0 0\n0 0 1 1\n0 1 1 0\n```\n- Violates the rule because the third column has three 0s.\n\n**Option C:**\n```\n1 0 0 1\n1 1 0 0\n0 0 0 1\n0 1 1 0\n```\n- Violates the rule because the third column has three 0s.\n\n**Option D:**\n```\n1 0 0 1\n1 1 0 0\n0 0 1 1\n0 1 1 1\n```\n- Violates the rule because the fourth column has three 1s.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe only option that satisfies all the rules is Option A.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{A}\n\\]", "ground_truth": "A", "prompt": "You need to solve a Binairo puzzle.\n\n**Binairo Puzzle Rules:**\n1.
