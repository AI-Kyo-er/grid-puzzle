It cannot be the top two since Row 1 and Row 2 already have their water cell in Column 1. Therefore, the water cell for Column 4 can either be in Row 3 or Row 4.\n\n- From Row 4 constraint (2 cells), one more cell needs to be filled in addition to the one in Column 1.

Hence, rows 1, 2, and 3 will have water in columns 1 and 2.\n   \n   - **Middle-right Tank (3x3):**\n     - Column 3 has 2-filled requirement. Since the upper two rows can satisfy it, rows 1 and 2 will have water in column 3.\n     - Column 4 has only 1-filled requirement. Thus, one of the middle-right tank’s rows must have water here. Row 4 fits best since it needs four filled cells.\n\n   - **Bottom-right Tank (2x2):**\n     - Row 5 requires all five cells filled, so both columns 4 and 5 in row 5 are filled.\n     - Column 5 has two filled requirements, already satisfied by row 5.
