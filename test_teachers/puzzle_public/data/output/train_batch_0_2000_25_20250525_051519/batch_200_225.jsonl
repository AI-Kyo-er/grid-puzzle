Both `[3,1]` and `[3,2]` must be filled.\n\n- Row 4: Clue `2` (two cells filled)\n  - Similarly, both `[4,1]` and `[4,2]` must be filled.\n\n- Row 5: Clue `4` (four cells filled)\n  - In this 3x3 tank, it's clear that all three columns (`[5,3]`, `[5,4]`, and `[5,5]`) will have their first two rows filled while `[6,1]`, `[6,2]` are already determined from previous steps.\n\n- Row 6: Clue `4` (four cells filled)\n  - Similar to Row 5, all three columns' second row in the 3x3 tank must be filled. \n\n#### Look at Column Clues:\n- Column 1: Clue `6` (six cells filled)\n  - All six cells in this column are indeed filled correctly through previous steps.\n\n- Column 2: Clue `5` (five cells filled)\n  - All five cells in this column are filled correctly through previous steps.\n\n- Column 3: Clue `2` (two cells filled)\n  - Only the last two cells `[5,3]` and `[6,3]` in the 3x3 tank were not previously filled in this step.\n\n- Column 4 & 5: Clue `0` (no cells filled)\n  - Confirmed as correct.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBy filling in as per the logic above and checking against all options, Option A matches exactly:\n\nOption A:\n```\n1 0 0 0 0 0\n1 1 0 0 0 0\n1 1 0 0 0 0\n1 1 0 0 0 0\n1 1 1 1 0 0\n1 1 1 1 0 0\n```\n\nThus, the final answer is \\boxed{A}.", "ground_truth": "A", "prompt": "You need to solve an Aquarium puzzle.\n\n**Aquarium Puzzle Rules:**\n1.  **The Grid:** The grid is divided into several regions called \"tanks\" by the thick colored (red) lines.\n2.  **The Goal:** Your goal is to fill some cells in the grid with \"water\".\n3.  **Water Levels:** Within each tank, water must settle at a uniform level.
