{"question_id": "aquarium_384", "response": "To solve this Aquarium puzzle, let's go through the steps for filling water while adhering to the given rules and clues.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n\n#### 1. Analyze the Grid and Clues\n\n- The grid is divided into tanks by red lines.\n- Row clues from the left side: `0, 0, 0, 2, 3, 6`.\n- Column clues from the top: `1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 2`.\n\n#### 2. Fill Water According to the Clues\n\n#### Row Analysis:\n- **Row 1 (clue = 0)**: No water can be filled in this row.\n- **Row 2 (clue = 0)**: No water can be filled in this row.\n- **Row 3 (clue = 0)**: No water can be filled in this row.\n- **Row 4 (clue = 2)**: Within the tank of this row, two cells need to be filled with water. Since the tank spans the fourth and fifth columns, these two columns should have water from this row down to the bottom of their tank.\n- **Row 5 (clue = 3)**: Three cells need to be filled with water. The tank spans the fourth, fifth, and sixth columns. These three columns should have water from this row down to the bottom of their respective tanks.\n- **Row 6 (clue = 6)**: All six cells in this row need to be filled with water.\n\n#### Column Analysis:\n- **Column 1 (clue = 1)**: One cell needs to be filled with water. The only possible cell is the last one because no other tank has space without violating other clues.\n- **Column 2 (clue = 1)**: Similar to Column 1, the only possible cell is the last one.\n- **Column 3 (clue = 1)**: Similar to Column 1 and 2, the only possible cell is the last one.\n- **Column 4 (clue = 3)**: Three cells need to be filled with water. From the earlier analysis, we know these would be rows 4, 5, and 6.\n- **Column 5 (clue = 3)**: Same as Column 4, three cells need to be filled in rows 4, 5, and 6.\n- **Column 6 (clue = 2)**: Two cells need to be filled with water. Based on previous deductions, these would be rows 5 and 6.\n\n#### Final Grid Configuration:\nBased on the above analysis, the final configuration should be:\n\n```\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 1 1 0\n0 0 0 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1\n```\n\nThis matches **Option D**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThus, the correct answer is \\(\\boxed{D}\\).", "ground_truth": "D", "prompt": "You need to solve an Aquarium puzzle.\n\n**Aquarium Puzzle Rules:**\n1.  **The Grid:** The grid is divided into several regions called \"tanks\" by the thick colored (red) lines.\n2.  **The Goal:** Your goal is to fill some cells in the grid with \"water\".\n3.  **Water Levels:** Within each tank, water must settle at a uniform level.

First Row: 2 + 9 + 3 + 7 + 3 + 5 = 29 (Incorrect; not matching the first row clue of 30)\n2. Even without checking further because of incorrect sum, we know Option B is invalid.\n\n#### Checking Option C:\n```\n2 9 3 7 8 5\n1 8 5 9 2 6\n4 2 9 1 7 2\n3 1 7 2 9 3\n8 3 6 4 5 8\n5 4 8 3 3 4\n```\n1.
