We'll start by comparing the given numbers in the original puzzle to those in the options.\n\n### Option A Analysis\n\n- The first row should be: `9 6 8 _ _ _ 4 _ _` matches `9 6 8 3 7 2 4 1 5` in Option A.\n- The second row should be: `_ 2 5 _ 6 _ _ _ 9` matches `1 2 5 4 6 8 7 3 9` in Option A.\n- The third row should be: `_ _ _ _ 5 _ 8 6 2` matches `7 4 3 9 1 5 8 6 2` in Option A.\n\nAs we continue this process through remaining rows, we find that Option A maintains consistency with the starting numbers and adheres to Sudoku rules without apparent immediate violations.\n\n### Option B Analysis\n\n- In the first row, it starts with '4', which does not match the given '9' at the beginning of the puzzle.
