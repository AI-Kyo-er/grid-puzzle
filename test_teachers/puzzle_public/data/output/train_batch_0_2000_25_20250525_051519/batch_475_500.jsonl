There are three tanks:\n- Tank 1: Top-left 2x2 area\n- Tank 2: Top-right 2x2 area\n- Tank 3: Bottom 4x2 area\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Row and Column Clues\nWe have the following clues:\n- Row clues: [2, 2, 4, 4]\n- Column clues: [2, 2, 4, 4]\n\n### Step 3: Fill Based on Clues and Constraints\n\n#### Tank 1 (Top-left 2x2):\n- We need 2 cells filled in both rows and columns of this tank.\n- If we fill the first cell of the first row, then the entire first column must be filled due to the water level rule.

There are five tanks.\n\n#### Filling Water Based on Clues and Rules:\n\n1. **Column 4 (rightmost column)**:\n   - Clue: 4\n   - Needs all four cells filled with water.\n   - Thus, the last four rows in this column should have water: \\( [0, 1, 1, 1, 1] \\).\n\n2. **Row 4 (bottom row)**:\n   - Clue: 4\n   - Needs all four cells filled with water.\n   - Thus, the entire row should have water: \\( [0, 1, 1, 1, 1] \\).\n\n3. **Row 3**:\n   - Clue: 3\n   - Needs three cells filled with water, and considering only one tank exists here.\n   - Thus, the bottom three cells should have water: \\( [0, 0, 1, 1, 1] \\).\n\n4. **Row 2**:\n   - Clue: 1\n   - Needs one cell filled with water in the rightmost tank.\n   - Thus, the only cell in the rightmost tank is filled with water: \\( [0, 0, 0, 0, 1] \\).\n\n5. **Row 1**:\n   - Clue: 1\n   - Needs one cell filled with water in the rightmost tank.\n   - Thus, the only cell in the rightmost tank is filled with water: \\( [0, 0, 0, 0, 1] \\).\n\n6. **Row 0**:\n   - Clue: 0\n   - No cell should have water.\n   - Thus, all cells are empty: \\( [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] \\).\n\n7. **Verify All Clues Match**:\n   - Summarize the analysis in the grid format and verify all clues match.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct grid configuration is:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{ccccc}\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThis matches exactly with Option D.\n\nThus, the final answer is \\(\\boxed{D}\\).", "ground_truth": "D", "prompt": "You need to solve an Aquarium puzzle.\n\n**Aquarium Puzzle Rules:**\n1.  **The Grid:** The grid is divided into several regions called \"tanks\" by the thick colored (red) lines.\n2.  **The Goal:** Your goal is to fill some cells in the grid with \"water\".\n3.  **Water Levels:** Within each tank, water must settle at a uniform level. This means: if a cell is filled with water, all cells directly below it *within the same tank* must also be filled, down to the bottom of that tank.\n4.  **Clues:** The numbers outside the grid indicate how many cells *in total* must be filled with water in that specific row (numbers on the left) or column (numbers on the top).\n5.  **Solving:** Use the numbers as clues to figure out which cells must be filled with water, ensuring that the water level rule within each tank is followed, until all numbers are satisfied.\n\n\nYour task is to choose the correct grid configuration from the options below that represents the solution to the puzzle.
