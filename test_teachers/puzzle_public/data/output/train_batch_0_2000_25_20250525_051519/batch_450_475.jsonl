This violates the rule that each digit must appear exactly once in each row.\n   \n   Therefore, Option A is incorrect.\n\n2. **Check Option B:**\n\n   - In the fourth row, there is a '7' in the fifth column which conflicts with the given '7' which should be in the sixth column according to provided grid.\n   \n   Therefore, Option B is incorrect.\n\n3. **Check Option C:**\n\n   - In the fifth row, there are two '5' in different columns within the same row.
