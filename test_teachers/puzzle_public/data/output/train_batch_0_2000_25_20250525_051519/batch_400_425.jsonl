{"question_id": "aquarium_31", "response": "To solve this Aquarium puzzle, we will follow these steps:\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n#### Step 1: Analyze the Row and Column Clues\n\n- Rows: \n    - Row 1: 3 cells filled\n    - Row 2: 3 cells filled\n    - Row 3: 3 cells filled\n    - Row 4: 4 cells filled\n    - Row 5: 5 cells filled\n    - Row 6: 5 cells filled\n\n- Columns:\n    - Col 1: 6 cells filled\n    - Col 2: 6 cells filled\n    - Col 3: 6 cells filled\n    - Col 4: 3 cells filled\n    - Col 5: 2 cells filled\n    - Col 6: 0 cells filled\n\n#### Step 2: Determine Water Levels in Tanks\n\n1. **Column 6** has no water (`0`).\n   \n2. **Columns 1, 2, 3** each have 6 cells filled with water (`1`). So, these columns should be completely filled with water up to the bottom.\n\n   ```plaintext\n   1 1 1 x x 0\n   1 1 1 x x 0\n   1 1 1 x x 0\n   1 1 1 x x 0\n   1 1 1 x x 0\n   1 1 1 x x 0\n   ```\n\n3. **Column 4**: Only 3 cells filled with water. It cannot start filling from the top since rows 1, 2, 3 already have their full count taken by columns 1, 2, 3. Thus, it has to start from row 4 downwards.\n\n   ```plaintext\n   1 1 1 0 x 0\n   1 1 1 0 x 0\n   1 1 1 0 x 0\n   1 1 1 1 x 0\n   1 1 1 1 x 0\n   1 1 1 1 x 0\n   ```\n\n4. **Column 5**: Only 2 cells filled with water. Since rows 1, 2, 3 already have their full count taken by columns 1, 2, 3, it can only start from row 5 downwards.\n\n   ```plaintext\n   1 1 1 0 0 0\n   1 1 1 0 0 0\n   1 1 1 0 0 0\n   1 1 1 1 0 0\n   1 1 1 1 1 0\n   1 1 1 1 1 0\n   ```\n\n#### Step 3: Verify the Options\n\nComparing our derived solution to the provided options:\n\n- Option A matches our derived solution exactly.\n\nThus, the correct option is:\n\n\\boxed{A}", "ground_truth": "A", "prompt": "You need to solve an Aquarium puzzle.\n\n**Aquarium Puzzle Rules:**\n1.  **The Grid:** The grid is divided into several regions called \"tanks\" by the thick colored (red) lines.\n2.  **The Goal:** Your goal is to fill some cells in the grid with \"water\".\n3.  **Water Levels:** Within each tank, water must settle at a uniform level. This means: if a cell is filled with water, all cells directly below it *within the same tank* must also be filled, down to the bottom of that tank.\n4.  **Clues:** The numbers outside the grid indicate how many cells *in total* must be filled with water in that specific row (numbers on the left) or column (numbers on the top).\n5.  **Solving:** Use the numbers as clues to figure out which cells must be filled with water, ensuring that the water level rule within each tank is followed, until all numbers are satisfied.\n\n\nYour task is to choose the correct grid configuration from the options below that represents the solution to the puzzle.
