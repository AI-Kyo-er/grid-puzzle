Let's go through the process step-by-step.\n\n### Step 1: Initial Setup and Known Values\n\nGiven the grid with some values already filled:\n- Blue cells are `0`.\n- Red cells are `1`.\n\nInitial grid:\n```\n0 |   | 1 |\n---------\n0 |   |   | 0\n---------\n  | 0 |   |\n---------\n  |   |   |\n```\n\n### Step 2: Apply Rule 1 & 2 - No More Than Two Consecutive Identical Numbers\n\nFill in the first row:\n- Since there can't be three consecutive `0`s or `1`s, and the first two cells have `0`, the third must be `1`. Similarly, if the first two are `0` and `1`, the next can't be `1` again, so it must be `0`.\n\nThus, the first row becomes:\n```\n0 | 0 | 1 | 1\n```\n\nNext, fill in the second row:\n- The first cell is `0`. To avoid three consecutive `0`s, the next cannot be `0`. Also, the last cell is `0`, so the preceding cell cannot be `0`.\n\nThus, the second row becomes:\n```\n0 | 1 | 1 | 0\n```\n\nThird row:\n- The middle cell is `0`. Thus, surrounding cells should alternate. Start by fitting permissible numbers such that no three identical values appear consecutively.\n\nThus, the third row becomes:\n```\n1 | 0 | 0 | 1\n```\n\nFourth row:\n- With the rule for equal count of `0`s and `1`s, and ensuring uniqueness among rows and columns:\n\nThus, the fourth row becomes:\n```\n1 | 1 | 0 | 0\n```\n\nFinal grid:\n```\n0 | 0 | 1 | 1\n0 | 1 | 1 | 0\n1 | 0 | 0 | 1\n1 | 1 | 0 | 0\n```\n\n### Step 3: Verification and Conclusion\n\nCompare the final grid with the options provided:\n\nThe final grid matches **Option A**:\n```\n0 0 1 1\n0 1 1 0\n1 0 0 1\n1 1 0 0\n```\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\n\\(\\boxed{A}\\)", "ground_truth": "A", "prompt": "You need to solve a Binairo puzzle.\n\n**Binairo Puzzle Rules:**\n1.

Top-left tank (1x2)\n2. Top-right tank (1x3)\n3. Middle tank (3x2)\n4. Bottom-right tank (1x1)\n\nClues:\n- Row clues: [0, 0, 3, 4]\n- Column clues: [1, 2, 2, 2]\n\n#### Solving Each Tank:\n\n**Top-Left Tank:**\n- Size: 1x2 cells\n- Row clue for row 1 = 0 (no water in this row)\n\nThus, both cells in the top-left tank remain empty.\n\n**Top-Right Tank:**\n- Size: 1x3 cells\n- Column clues for these three columns are 2, 2, and 2 respectively.\n\nSince no other horizontal clues affect this row, we need to determine the water based on the vertical clues alone.
