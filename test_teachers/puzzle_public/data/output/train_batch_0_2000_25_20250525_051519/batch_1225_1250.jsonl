{"question_id": "aquarium_84", "response": "To solve this Aquarium Puzzle, let's break it down step-by-step according to the rules:\n\n### Step 1: Understanding Tank Boundaries\n\nThe red lines define the tanks:\n- Top row spans columns 1-2 and 3-5.\n- Second row spans columns 1-2 and 3-5.\n- Third row spans columns 1-2 and 3-5.\n- Fourth row spans columns 1-2 and a separate tank for column 3 and another for columns 4-5.\n- Fifth row spans columns 1-2 and 3-5.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing Row/Column Clues\n\n#### Column Clues (Top):\n1. Columns 1 & 2 both have a clue of '1'. Thus, only one cell in these columns per tank can be filled.\n2. Columns 3, 4, & 5 all have a clue of '2'. Thus, two cells in these columns per tank can be filled.\n\n#### Row Clues (Left):\n1. Rows 1, 2, & 3 all have a clue of '0'. Thus, no cells in these rows can be filled.\n2. Row 4 has a clue of '3'. Thus, three cells in this row can be filled.\n3. Row 5 has a clue of '5'. Thus, all five cells in this row must be filled.\n\n### Step 3: Filling the Grid Based on Constraints\n\n#### Rows 1, 2, 3:\nSince their clues are '0', none of these rows contain water.\n```plaintext\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n```\n\n#### Row 4:\nThe clue is '3', and it must satisfy water levels within tanks.\n- Columns 1-2 cannot have water because their respective column clues ('1') would be exceeded.\n- This leaves columns 3-5, where two cells per column can be filled. To satisfy the '3' clue, the only possible configuration is:\n```plaintext\n0 0 1 1 1\n```\n\n#### Row 5:\nThe clue is '5', so all cells must be filled.\n```plaintext\n1 1 1 1 1\n```\n\nCombining all:\n```plaintext\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1\n```\n\nThis matches Option A.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\boxed{A}", "ground_truth": "A", "prompt": "You need to solve an Aquarium puzzle.\n\n**Aquarium Puzzle Rules:**\n1.  **The Grid:** The grid is divided into several regions called \"tanks\" by the thick colored (red) lines.\n2.  **The Goal:** Your goal is to fill some cells in the grid with \"water\".\n3.  **Water Levels:** Within each tank, water must settle at a uniform level.
