{"question_id": "aquarium_679", "response": "To solve this Aquarium puzzle, let's analyze the constraints provided by the numbers outside the grid and apply the water-level rule for tanks.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Analyze the rows with the number 0:**\n\n   - Rows 1 and 2 have a '0'. This means no water can be present in these rows.\n   - Therefore, the first two rows should be entirely filled with zeros.\n\n2. **Analyze the columns with the number 3:**\n\n   - Columns 4 and 6 have a '3'. These columns must have exactly three water cells.\n   - Since the water level must be uniform within each tank, and considering the positions of the red lines, we see that there isn't enough space in any part of the grid for such a configuration without violating other constraints.\n\n3. **Analyze the rows with the number 4:**\n\n   - Row 3 has a '4'. This row needs four water cells.\n   - Row 4 has a '4'. This row also needs four water cells.\n   - Given the tanks layout and the earlier zero-filled rows, only certain parts of these rows can be filled.\n\n4. **Analyze the rows with the number 6:**\n\n   - Rows 5, 6, and 7 have a '6'.
