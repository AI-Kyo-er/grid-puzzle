{"question_id": "aquarium_231", "response": "To solve this Aquarium puzzle, we need to follow the clues for both rows and columns while ensuring that within each tank, water settles uniformly from the bottom up.\n\n### Column Clues Analysis\n- **Column 1:** Clue is 3. This means there should be exactly three water-filled cells in this column. Since it's one large tank spanning four rows, the water will occupy the last three rows.\n- **Column 2:** Clue is 4. This means there should be exactly four water-filled cells in this column. Given it spans five rows in one large tank, the water will occupy the last four rows.\n- **Column 3:** Clue is 3. It indicates three water-filled cells in this column. In the tank structure, this tank starts from the second row and spans three rows. Thus, the last two rows plus the first row of the tank will have water.\n- **Columns 4 and 5:** Both have a clue of 3. They span the last three rows each entirely within their respective tanks.\n\n### Row Clues Analysis\n- **Row 1:** Clue is 0. This row remains empty.\n- **Row 2:** Clue is 1. This indicates only one water-filled cell. Given the tank structure, only the square in the second column can be filled.\n- **Rows 3, 4, and 5:** All have a clue of 5, meaning all five cells in these rows are filled with water. This fits the tank layouts and water level requirement.\n\n### Resulting Solution\nBased on the above analysis, let’s verify the options:\n\n- Option A:\n    ```\n    0 0 0 0 0\n    0 1 0 0 0\n    1 1 1 1 1\n    1 1 1 1 1\n    1 1 1 1 1\n    ```\n  This matches our deductions perfectly.

{"question_id": "aquarium_132", "response": "To solve this Aquarium puzzle, we will follow the rules and use the provided clues for rows and columns. Here’s the detailed step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Analyze the Tanks and Clues:**\n   - The grid is divided into tanks by red lines.\n   - Row and column numbers give the total number of filled cells in that row/column.\n\n2. **Start with Column Clues:**\n   - Column 1 has a clue `2` at the top.\n     - Tank 1 in Column 1 has only one cell. It cannot have water because it would exceed the clue `2`.\n     - Tank 2 in Column 1 spans 4 cells. Since the clue is `2`, exactly two of these four cells should be filled.\n   - Column 2 has a clue `2` at the top.\n     - Tank 1 in Column 2 has only one cell. It cannot have water because it would exceed the clue `2`.\n     - Tank 2 in Column 2 spans 4 cells. Exactly two of these four cells should be filled.\n   - Column 3 has a clue `2` at the top.\n     - Tank 1 in Column 3 has only one cell. It cannot have water because it would exceed the clue `2`.\n     - Tank 2 in Column 3 spans 4 cells. Exactly two of these four cells should be filled.\n   - Column 4 has a clue `4` at the top.\n     - Tank 1 in Column 4 spans 2 cells.\n       - Since the clue is `4` but only `2` cells are available, both cells must be filled.\n     - Tank 2 in Column 4 spans 4 cells. All 4 cells must be filled to meet the clue `4`.\n\n3. **Start with Row Clues:**\n   - Row 1 has a clue `1` on the left.\n     - Tank 1 in Row 1 spans 3 cells. Only one of these three cells can be filled.\n     - It is observed that the rightmost cell in Row 1 and Column 4 must be filled based on column clue `4`. Thus, the other two cells in Tank 1 of Row 1 remain empty.\n   - Row 2 has a clue `1` on the left.\n     - Tank 1 in Row 2 spans 3 cells. Only one of these three cells can be filled.\n     - Similarly, the rightmost cell in Row 2 and Column 4 must be filled based on column clue `4`. Thus, the other two cells in Tank 1 of Row 2 remain empty.\n   - Row 3 has a clue `4` on the left.\n     - Tank 1 in Row 3 spans 4 cells. All 4 cells must be filled.\n   - Row 4 has a clue `4` on the left.\n     - Tank 1 in Row 4 spans 4 cells. All 4 cells must be filled.\n\n4. **Verify the Solution:**\n   - Option C perfectly fits all the clues and constraints:\n     ```\n     0 0 0 1\n     0 0 0 1\n     1 1 1 1\n     1 1 1 1\n     ```\n\nSo, the correct answer is \\boxed{C}.", "ground_truth": "C", "prompt": "You need to solve an Aquarium puzzle.\n\n**Aquarium Puzzle Rules:**\n1.  **The Grid:** The grid is divided into several regions called \"tanks\" by the thick colored (red) lines.\n2.  **The Goal:** Your goal is to fill some cells in the grid with \"water\".\n3.  **Water Levels:** Within each tank, water must settle at a uniform level.
