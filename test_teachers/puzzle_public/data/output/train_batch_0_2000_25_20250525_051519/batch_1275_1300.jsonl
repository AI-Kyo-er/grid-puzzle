We can see that the only missing numbers are: `1`, `2`, `7` and `8`. \n\n- Option A: `3 6 2 4 8 5 9 7 1` → This fits perfectly.\n- Option B: `3 6 2 1 8 5 9 7 1` → This has two `1`'s, which violates the Sudoku rule. So, eliminate Option B.\n- Option C: `3 6 2 4 8 5 9 7 1` → This matches Option A and seems valid so far.\n- Option D: `3 6 2 4 8 5 9 7 1` → This also matches Option A/C and appears valid so far.\n\n#### Second Row\nThe second row of the puzzle is `_ _ 4 _ 1 9 _ _ _`. The missing numbers include `2`, `3`, `5`, `6`, `7`, `8`.\n\n- Option A: `5 8 4 7 1 9 6 3 2` → This fits the Sudoku constraints.\n- Option C: `5 8 4 7 1 9 6 3 2` → Matches Option A and is valid.\n- Option D: `5 8 4 7 1 9 6 3 2` → Also matches Option A/C and seems valid.\n\n#### Third Row\nThe third row of the puzzle is `9 7 _ 6 2 _ 8 5 4`. The missing numbers include `1`, `3`.\n\n- Option A: `9 7 1 6 2 3 8 5 4` → This fits the Sudoku constraints.\n- Option C: `9 7 1 6 2 3 8 5 4` → Matches Option A and is valid.\n- Option D: `9 7 1 6 2 3 8 5 4` → Also matches Option A/C and seems valid.\n\n#### Seventh Row\nThe seventh row of the puzzle is `8 _ 9 _ _ _ 3 4 _`. The missing numbers include `1`, `2`, `5`, `6`, `7`.\n\n- Option A: `8 1 9 2 5 7 3 4 6` → This fits the Sudoku constraints.\n- Option C: `8 1 9 2 5 7 3 4 6` → Matches Option A and is valid.\n- Option D: `8 1 9 9 5 7 3 4 6` → Has two `9`'s which violates the Sudoku rule.

We are left with Options A and C.\n\nUpon closer inspection:\n- Both options seem identical, but let’s ensure all rules comply.\n\nAfter confirming every detail:\nOption A and Option C match completely.
