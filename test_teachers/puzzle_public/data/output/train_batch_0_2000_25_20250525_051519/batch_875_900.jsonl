Observing the tanks, we see that the rightmost cell must be filled because the clue is 2, and it belongs to a separate tank. Therefore, this row should look like:\n\n```\n0 0 0 0 0 1\n```\n\n#### Second Row (Clue: 0)\nThe second row cannot have any filled cells since the clue is 0.

Given the uniform water level rule, the water can't be split across the tank. So, the leftmost cell will be filled:\n    ```\n    0 0 1 0 0\n    ```\n\n- **Row 2 (3 water cells):**\n    There are two tanks in this row. The first tank has 2 cells and the second has 3 cells. To satisfy the 3 water cells, all 3 cells in the larger tank must be filled:\n    ```\n    0 0 1 1 1\n    ```\n\n- **Row 3 (5 water cells):**\n    This row has 5 cells in a single tank.

Here's how they're divided:\n\n- Top-left tank: 2x2 cells\n- Top-right tank: 2x2 cells\n- Bottom-left tank: 2x3 cells\n- Bottom-right tank: 2x2 cells\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Row Clues\n\n- Row 1: Needs 1 filled cell.\n- Row 2: Needs 3 filled cells.\n- Row 3: Needs 4 filled cells.\n- Row 4: Needs 4 filled cells.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Column Clues\n\n- Column 1: Needs 4 filled cells.\n- Column 2: Needs 3 filled cells.\n- Column 3: Needs 3 filled cells.\n- Column 4: Needs 2 filled cells.\n\n### Step 4: Fill in the Grid Based on Constraints\n\n#### Start with Row 1:\n- Row 1 needs only 1 filled cell. It can't be in the top-right tank because it needs 2 continuous filled cells there.\n- Therefore, the single filled cell must be in the top-left tank, specifically in the first column (to satisfy the column 1 clue).\n\n#### Move to Row 2 & Tank Constraints:\n- Row 2 needs 3 filled cells. In the top-left tank, the second row must be completely filled.\n- In the top-right tank, the first two columns of the second row must be filled.\n\n#### Consider Rows 3 and 4:\n- Row 3 and Row 4 need all cells filled since both have a clue of 4. This fills the entire bottom-left and bottom-right tanks.\n\n### Step 5: Validate Solution with Options\n\nNow we compare our analysis with the given options:\n\n**Option A:**\n```\n1 0 0 0    (Row 1: Incorrect - Needs 1 filled cell)\n1 1 1 0    (Row 2: Correct - 3 filled cells)\n0 1 1 1    (Row 3: Incorrect - Needs 4 filled cells)\n0 1 1 1    (Row 4: Incorrect - Needs 4 filled cells)\n```\nDoes not match.\n\n**Option B:**\n```\n1 0 0 0    (Row 1: Correct - 1 filled cell)\n1 1 0 1    (Row 2: Incorrect - Top-right tank non-uniform)\n1 1 1 1    (Row 3: Correct - 4 filled cells)\n1 1 1 1    (Row 4: Correct - 4 filled cells)\n```\nDoes not match.\n\n**Option C:**\n```\n1 0 0 0    (Row 1: Correct - 1 filled cell)\n1 1 1 0    (Row 2: Correct - 3 filled cells)\n1 1 1 1    (Row 3: Correct - 4 filled cells)\n1 1 1 1    (Row 4: Correct - 4 filled cells)\n```\nMatches.\n\n**Option D:**\n```\n1 1 0 0    (Row 1: Incorrect - Needs 1 filled cell)\n1 1 1 0    (Row 2: Correct - 3 filled cells)\n1 1 1 1    (Row 3: Correct - 4 filled cells)\n1 1 1 1    (Row 4: Correct - 4 filled cells)\n```\nDoes not match.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\(\\boxed{C}\\)", "ground_truth": "C", "prompt": "You need to solve an Aquarium puzzle.\n\n**Aquarium Puzzle Rules:**\n1.  **The Grid:** The grid is divided into several regions called \"tanks\" by the thick colored (red) lines.\n2.  **The Goal:** Your goal is to fill some cells in the grid with \"water\".\n3.  **Water Levels:** Within each tank, water must settle at a uniform level.
