In Tank 1, only one cell can be filled without violating the levels. Therefore, both cells in Tank 2 must be filled. \n\n#### Row 2:\n- Clue is 4, so all four cells must be filled with water.\n\n#### Row 3:\n- Clue is 4, so all four cells must be filled with water.\n\n### Step 4: Check Columns\n\n- **Column 0:** Should have 2 filled cells. Rows 2 and 3 are filled, satisfying this.\n- **Column 1:** Should have 3 filled cells. Row 1, 2, and 3 are filled, satisfying this.\n- **Column 2 and 3:** Should have 3 filled cells each.

{"question_id": "kakuro_73", "response": "Let's solve this Kakuro puzzle using step-by-step logic.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze Given Constraints\n\nLooking at the clues and the blank spaces:\n\n- Top row has three cells and a sum of 23.\n- Second row has three cells and a sum of 13.\n- Third row has three cells and a sum of 14.\n- First column has three cells and a sum of 18.\n- Second column has three cells and a sum of 21.\n\n### Step 2: Begin with the top row constraint (sum = 23)\n\nPossible combinations for three distinct digits (1-9) that add up to 23 are:\n- 9 + 8 + 6 = 23\n- 9 + 7 + 7 = 23 (Not valid as 7 repeats)\n- Other combinations don’t fit\n\nSo, the only valid combination is 9, 8, 6. We need to place these numbers while satisfying other constraints.\n\n### Step 3: Check the first column constraint (sum = 18)\n\nFirst column has three cells adding up to 18 and starts with either 9, 8, or 6. Let's check with 9 placed in the top-left corner:\n\nIf the top-left corner is 9:\n- Remaining two cells in the first column should add up to 9 (since 18 - 9 = 9). Possible pairs: (6, 3), (5, 4).\n\n### Step 4: Check consistency with other constraints\n\nLet's place 9, 8, 6 in top row. Assume placing 6 in the second column of the top row:\n\nTop row: [9, 8, 6]\nFirst column: [9, x, y] needs to add to 18 => x + y = 9\n\nNow let's look at second column: sum = 21 and starting with 8:\n- Possible combinations for remaining two cells: 6+7=13, others invalid\n\n### Step 5: Verify the Solution\n\nPlacing:\n- Top row: [9, 8, 6]\n- Second row: [3, 4, 6] (satisfies 13 in second row, 21 in second column)\n- Third row: [6, 7, 1] (satisfies 18 in first column and 14 in third row)\n\nThis matches Option D:\n```\n9 8 6\n3 4 2\n6 7 1\n```\n\nFinally, the correct solution is in \\boxed{D}.", "ground_truth": "D", "prompt": "You need to solve a 3x3 Kakuro puzzle.\n\n**Kakuro Puzzle Rules (3x3 Grid):**\n1. **Grid:** The grid is a 3x3 square, containing blank cells and clue cells.\n2. **Objective:** Fill all blank cells with numbers from 1 to 9.\n3. **Constraints:** Each digit (1 to 9) must satisfy the following conditions:\n    a.
