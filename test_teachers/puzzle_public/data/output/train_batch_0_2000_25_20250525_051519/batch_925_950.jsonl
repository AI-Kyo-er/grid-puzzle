There is only one tank spanning this row with more than one cell, so the water must fill exactly one cell in the third column from the right (as indicated by the clue).\n   - Thus, Row 2 is: `0 0 0 1 0`.\n\n3. **Row 3 (with clue '3')**: Three cells in this row should have water.

The water needs to fill three cells in the larger tank in this row.\n   - Hence, Row 4 is: `0 0 1 1 1`.\n\n5. **Row 5 (with clue '3')**: Again, three cells in this row should have water within the larger tank.\n   - Thus, Row 5 is: `0 0 1 1 1`.\n\n### Column Analysis for Verification:\n1. **Column 1 (clue '0')**: Confirmed no water in any cell.\n2. **Column 2 (clue '0')**: Confirmed no water in any cell.\n3. **Column 3 (clue '3')**: Confirmed three cells filled.\n4. **Column 4 (clue '4')**: Confirmed four cells filled.\n5. **Column 5 (clue '3')**: Confirmed three cells filled.\n\n### Final Solution:\nComparing the deduced grid with the given options:\n\n```\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 1 0\n0 0 1 1 1\n0 0 1 1 1\n0 0 1 1 1\n```\n\nThis matches Option C exactly.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is \\boxed{C}.", "ground_truth": "C", "prompt": "You need to solve an Aquarium puzzle.\n\n**Aquarium Puzzle Rules:**\n1.  **The Grid:** The grid is divided into several regions called \"tanks\" by the thick colored (red) lines.\n2.  **The Goal:** Your goal is to fill some cells in the grid with \"water\".\n3.  **Water Levels:** Within each tank, water must settle at a uniform level.
