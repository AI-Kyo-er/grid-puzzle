Row 1 has one '1'. This means one cell needs to be filled with water in this row.\n2. Row 2 has one '1', meaning one cell needs to be filled with water in this row.\n3. Row 3 has one '1', so one cell needs to be filled with water in this row.\n4. Row 4 has two '2', indicating two cells need to be filled with water in this row.\n5. Row 5 has three '3', so three cells need to be filled with water in this row.\n\n#### Column Clues (Top Side):\n1. Column 1 has one '1'. This means one cell needs to be filled with water in this column.\n2. Column 2 has zero '0', so no cells should be filled with water in this column.\n3. Column 3 has zero '0', so no cells should be filled with water in this column.\n4. Column 4 has two '2', indicating two cells need to be filled with water in this column.\n5. Column 5 has five '5', so all five cells need to be filled with water in this column.\n\n#### Analyzing the Tanks:\n- Tank 1: Columns 1, 2, and 3 have no tanks in common with other tanks due to thick lines. So consider them separately along with their respective row clues.\n- Tank 2: Columns 4 and 5 form a single tank. Considering column 4 needs 2 filled cells and column 5 needs all 5 filled cells. \n\n#### Filling the Grid:\n- For the first row, the only possible place for water is the last cell (column 5).\n- For the second row, again the only possible place for water is the last cell (column 5).\n- For the third row, similarly, the only possible place for water is the last cell (column 5).\n- For the fourth row, based on the tank constraint, the only way to satisfy both column 4 (2 filled cells) and column 5 (all 5 filled cells) is filling the last two cells.\n- For the fifth row, since column 5 needs all 5 and column 4 needs exactly 2 filled cells, filling the last 3 cells of the row will satisfy column 5 and partially column 4; then filling up to the second cell in column 4 will complete the required count.\n\nBased on the elimination and satisfying all cues:\n\nThe configuration matches correctly with Option A:\n\n```\n0 0 0 0 1\n0 0 0 0 1\n0 0 0 0 1\n0 0 0 1 1\n1 0 0 1 1\n```\n\nThus, the correct answer is \\boxed{A}.", "ground_truth": "A", "prompt": "You need to solve an Aquarium puzzle.\n\n**Aquarium Puzzle Rules:**\n1.  **The Grid:** The grid is divided into several regions called \"tanks\" by the thick colored (red) lines.\n2.  **The Goal:** Your goal is to fill some cells in the grid with \"water\".\n3.  **Water Levels:** Within each tank, water must settle at a uniform level.

This means three cells in the first row should have water.\n  - The second, third, fourth rows also have a clue '3'.\n  - The fifth row has a clue '4'. This means four cells in the fifth row should have water.\n\n- **Columns:**\n  - The first column has a clue '0'. This means no cells in the first column should have water.\n  - The second column has a clue '1'. This means one cell in the second column should have water.\n  - The third, fourth, and fifth columns have a clue '5'. This means five cells in these columns should have water.\n\n#### Step 2: Determine Water Levels per Tank Constraints\n\nGiven the tank divisions marked by red lines, we must ensure the water levels in each tank follow the rules:\n\n1. **Top-left tank (2x2):**\n   - No water in the first column.\n   - One water cell in the second column.\n   - Thus, the only way to place one water cell in the second column while satisfying the row clue '3' for the first two rows is:\n     ```\n     0 1\n     0 1\n     ```\n\n2. **Middle-right tank (3x2):**\n   - Needs to have 5 water cells in both fourth and fifth columns.\n   - Since the tank is 3 cells high, all three rows in the middle-right tank should be filled up to the right edge:\n     ```\n     1 1\n     1 1\n     1 1\n     ```\n\n3. **Bottom-left tank (2x2):**\n   - Needs to satisfy the fifth row clue of '4'.\n   - As the second column needs only one water cell and already has two from above, the remaining two water cells can be distributed in the bottom row:\n     ```\n     0 0\n     1 1\n     ```\n\nCombining all the observations, the correct grid would look like this:\n\n```\n0 1 1 1 1\n0 1 1 1 1\n0 0 1 1 1\n0 0 1 1 1\n0 1 1 1 1\n```\n\n### Verifying with Options\n\nUpon comparing the derived grid with the provided options, Option B matches perfectly:\n\n```\n0 0 1 1 1\n0 1 1 1 1\n0 0 1 1 1\n0 0 1 1 1\n0 1 1 1 1\n```\n\nSo, the answer is \\boxed{B}.", "ground_truth": "A", "prompt": "You need to solve an Aquarium puzzle.\n\n**Aquarium Puzzle Rules:**\n1.  **The Grid:** The grid is divided into several regions called \"tanks\" by the thick colored (red) lines.\n2.  **The Goal:** Your goal is to fill some cells in the grid with \"water\".\n3.  **Water Levels:** Within each tank, water must settle at a uniform level.

{"question_id": "aquarium_663", "response": "To solve this Aquarium puzzle, let’s go step-by-step while considering the clues provided for both rows and columns.\n\n### Step 1: Analyzing the Rows\n\nThe row clues tell us the following:\n- The first four rows have a clue of `2`. This means each of these rows must have exactly two cells filled with water.\n- The fifth row has a clue of `2`, so it must have exactly two cells filled with water.\n- The sixth row has a clue of `3`, so it must have exactly three cells filled with water.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Columns\n\nThe column clues tell us the following:\n- The first two columns have a clue of `6`. This means six cells in each of these columns must be filled with water, which implies that all six cells in these columns will be filled.\n- The third column has a clue of `1`. This means only one cell in this column must be filled with water.\n- The last three columns have a clue of `0`, meaning no cells should be filled with water in these columns.\n\n### Step 3: Filling the Grid Based on Clues\n\nUsing the above information, let’s start filling the grid:\n\n#### Filling the first two columns:\nSince the first two columns must have water in all six cells, we can mark these cells as filled:\n```\n1 1 0 0 0 0\n1 1 0 0 0 0\n1 1 0 0 0 0\n1 1 0 0 0 0\n1 1 0 0 0 0\n1 1 0 0 0 0\n```\n\n#### Filling the third column based on the clue `1`:\nThe third column must have exactly one cell filled with water. Given the \"water settling\" rule, this single filled cell must be at the bottom of its tank. Thus, the bottom cell in the third column will be filled:\n```\n1 1 0 0 0 0\n1 1 0 0 0 0\n1 1 0 0 0 0\n1 1 0 0 0 0\n1 1 0 0 0 0\n1 1 1 0 0 0\n```\n\n#### Verifying the remaining rows:\nNow we check the remaining rows to ensure they meet their respective clues:\n- The first five rows still need to satisfy the clue of two filled cells but already do since the first two columns are filled.\n- The sixth row needs three filled cells and has them thanks to the previous steps.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter verifying all the clues match our filled grid, the correct configuration matches **Option A**:\n```\n1 1 0 0 0 0\n1 1 0 0 0 0\n1 1 0 0 0 0\n1 1 0 0 0 0\n1 1 0 0 0 0\n1 1 1 0 0 0\n```\n\nTherefore, the final answer is \\boxed{A}.", "ground_truth": "A", "prompt": "You need to solve an Aquarium puzzle.\n\n**Aquarium Puzzle Rules:**\n1.  **The Grid:** The grid is divided into several regions called \"tanks\" by the thick colored (red) lines.\n2.  **The Goal:** Your goal is to fill some cells in the grid with \"water\".\n3.  **Water Levels:** Within each tank, water must settle at a uniform level.
