Also, in the 5th row, there are two 8's.

{"question_id": "aquarium_695", "response": "To determine the correct grid configuration, we need to satisfy both the row and column clues while adhering to the water level rules within each tank.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n#### Step 1: Analyze the Row Clues\n\n- **Row 1** has a clue of `2`. This indicates that only 2 cells in this row should be filled with water. The first tank spans the first two columns, so these two cells must be filled.\n- **Row 2** also has a clue of `2`, similar to Row 1. The same logic applies, filling the first two cells of this row.\n- **Row 3** has a clue of `2` again. The first tank spans the first two columns, so these two cells must be filled.\n- **Row 4** has a clue of `6`. This indicates that all six cells in this row should be filled with water, since there is only one tank that spans the entire row.\n- **Row 5** has a clue of `6`. Similar to Row 4, all six cells in this row should be filled with water.\n- **Row 6** has a clue of `6`. Similar to Rows 4 and 5, all six cells in this row should be filled with water.\n\n#### Step 2: Analyze the Column Clues\n\n- **Column 1** has a clue of `6`. This means all six cells in this column must be filled.\n- **Column 2** has a clue of `6`. This means all six cells in this column must be filled.\n- **Column 3** has a clue of `3`. This means three cells in this column must be filled. Since the tank spans rows 1-3, these three cells should be filled.\n- **Column 4** has a clue of `3`. This means three cells in this column must be filled. Since the tank spans rows 1-3, these three cells should be filled.\n- **Column 5** has a clue of `3`. This means three cells in this column must be filled. Since the tank spans rows 1-3, these three cells should be filled.\n- **Column 6** has a clue of `3`. This means three cells in this column must be filled. Since the tank spans rows 1-3, these three cells should be filled.\n\n#### Step 3: Verify the Options\n\n- **Option A**:\n    ```\n    1 1 0 0 0 0\n    1 1 0 0 0 0\n    1 1 0 0 0 0\n    1 1 1 1 1 1\n    1 1 1 1 1 1\n    1 1 1 1 1 1\n    ```\n    - Satisfies all row and column clues.\n    - Water levels are consistent within each tank.\n\n- **Option B**:\n    ```\n    1 1 0 0 0 0\n    1 1 1 0 0 0\n    1 1 0 0 0 0\n    1 1 1 1 1 0\n    1 1 1 1 1 1\n    1 1 1 1 1 1\n    ```\n    - Does not satisfy the column clues for columns 3, 4, 5, and 6.\n\n- **Option C**:\n    ```\n    1 1 0 0 0 0\n    1 1 0 0 0 0\n    1 1 0 0 1 0\n    1 1 1 1 1 1\n    1 1 1 1 1 1\n    1 1 1 1 1 1\n    ```\n    - Does not satisfy the water level rule in the third row for column 5.\n\n- **Option D**:\n    ```\n    1 1 0 0 0 0\n    1 1 0 0 0 0\n    1 1 0 0 0 0\n    1 1 1 1 0 1\n    1 1 1 1 1 0\n    1 1 1 1 1 1\n    ```\n    - Does not satisfy the water level rule in the fourth row for columns 5 and 6.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe correct grid configuration that satisfies all the rules and clues is Option A.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{A}\n\\]", "ground_truth": "A", "prompt": "You need to solve an Aquarium puzzle.\n\n**Aquarium Puzzle Rules:**\n1.  **The Grid:** The grid is divided into several regions called \"tanks\" by the thick colored (red) lines.\n2.  **The Goal:** Your goal is to fill some cells in the grid with \"water\".\n3.  **Water Levels:** Within each tank, water must settle at a uniform level.

Both cells in this row will be filled since they are part of the same tank.\n\n#### Column Analysis:\n1. **Column 1 (with clue '0')**: No cells should be filled.\n2. **Column 2 (with clue '0')**: No cells should be filled.\n3. **Column 3 (with clue '1')**: One cell in the bottom-right tank will be filled, which we already identified from the row analysis.\n4. **Column 4 (with clue '4')**: All four cells in the top-right tank and bottom-right tank should be filled, which we have confirmed from the row analysis.\n\n### Step 3: Fill the Grid Based on the Analysis\n\nBased on the analysis above, the grid should look like this:\n```\n0 0 0 1\n0 0 0 1\n0 0 0 1\n0 0 1 1\n```\n\nThis matches Option A.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThus, the correct option is \\boxed{A}.", "ground_truth": "A", "prompt": "You need to solve an Aquarium puzzle.\n\n**Aquarium Puzzle Rules:**\n1.  **The Grid:** The grid is divided into several regions called \"tanks\" by the thick colored (red) lines.\n2.  **The Goal:** Your goal is to fill some cells in the grid with \"water\".\n3.  **Water Levels:** Within each tank, water must settle at a uniform level.

{"question_id": "aquarium_340", "response": "To solve this puzzle, we'll use the provided numbers as guides for filling the grid while adhering to aquarium rules. Let's go step-by-step:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze Rows and Columns\n\n#### Row Analysis:\n- **Row 0,1,2**: All have 0 water cells. Hence, no cells are filled in these rows.\n- **Row 3**: Has 2 water cells. So two consecutive cells in the same tank should be filled.\n- **Row 4**: Has 4 water cells. So four consecutive cells in the same tank should be filled.\n- **Row 5**: Has 5 water cells. So five consecutive cells in the same tank should be filled.\n\n#### Column Analysis:\n- **Column 0,1,3**: All have 0 water cells. Hence, no cells are filled in these columns.\n- **Column 2**: Has 3 water cells. So three consecutive cells in the same tank should be filled.\n- **Column 4,5**: Both have 2 water cells. So two consecutive cells in the same tank should be filled.\n\n### Step 2: Filling Cells Based on Constraints\n\nWe start by filling the tanks according to the water level rules.\n\n#### Row 3:\n- Needs 2 water cells. Only suitable position is the middle two cells (2nd and 3rd within the middle tank). Thus, we fill them.\n  \n```markdown\n...11...\n```\n\n#### Row 4:\n- Needs 4 water cells. The only suitable position is the last four cells (last four within the bottom-right tank). Thus, we fill them.\n  \n```markdown\n....1111\n```\n\n#### Row 5:\n- Needs 5 water cells. The only suitable position is the last five cells (last five within the bottom-right tank). Thus, we fill them.\n  \n```markdown\n....11111\n```\n\n### Step 3: Verifying with Columns\n\n#### Column 2:\n- Needs 3 water cells. We already filled three consecutive cells in Row 3, 4, 5.\n\n#### Column 4,5:\n- Needs 2 water cells. We already filled two consecutive cells in Row 4 and 5.\n\nBoth row and column constraints are satisfied.\n\n### Conclusion\nLooking at the given options, Option D matches our filled grid:\n\n```markdown\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 1 0 0\n0 0 1 1 1 1\n0 1 1 1 1 1\n```\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\n\\boxed{D}", "ground_truth": "D", "prompt": "You need to solve an Aquarium puzzle.\n\n**Aquarium Puzzle Rules:**\n1.  **The Grid:** The grid is divided into several regions called \"tanks\" by the thick colored (red) lines.\n2.  **The Goal:** Your goal is to fill some cells in the grid with \"water\".\n3.  **Water Levels:** Within each tank, water must settle at a uniform level.
