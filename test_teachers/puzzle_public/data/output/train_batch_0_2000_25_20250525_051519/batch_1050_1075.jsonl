{"question_id": "aquarium_442", "response": "To solve this Aquarium puzzle, we will follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Tanks\n\nFirst, identify the tanks based on the bold red lines:\n- Top-left tank (2x2): cells [1,1] to [2,2].\n- Middle-right tank (2x3): cells [3,3] to [4,5].\n- Bottom-left tank (3x2): cells [5,1] to [7,2].\n\n### Step 2: Use Row and Column Clues\n\n#### Row Analysis:\n- Row 1 & 2 have a clue of `2`, meaning two cells must be filled in these rows.\n- Row 3 has a clue of `4`, meaning four cells must be filled.\n- Row 4 & 5 have a clue of `5`, meaning five cells must be filled.\n\n#### Column Analysis:\n- Column 1, 2, 3, & 4 have a clue of `5` each, meaning all cells in these columns must be filled.\n- Column 5 has a clue of `2`, meaning two cells must be filled.\n\n### Step 3: Fill Cells Based on Constraints\n\n#### Top-left Tank (2x2):\n- Both rows must have exactly 2 filled cells.\n- Columns 1 and 2 must all be filled.\n- Thus, this tank should look like:\n```\n1 1 0 0 0\n1 1 0 0 0\n```\n\n#### Middle-right Tank (2x3):\n- Row 3: Must have 4 filled cells out of 5.\n- Row 4: Must have 5 filled cells.\n- Columns 3, 4, and 5: Only column 5 can be partially filled due to clue.\n- Thus, this tank should look like:\n```\n1 1 1 1 0\n1 1 1 1 1\n```\n\n#### Bottom-left Tank (3x2):\n- Rows 5 and 6 must have 5 filled cells, so entire rows and columns should be filled.\n- Thus, this tank should look like:\n```\n1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1\n```\n\n### Step 4: Verify Against Options\n\nThe resulting grid looks like:\n```\n1 1 0 0 0\n1 1 0 0 0\n1 1 1 1 0\n1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1\n```\n\nThis matches with Option C.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{C}\n\\]", "ground_truth": "C", "prompt": "You need to solve an Aquarium puzzle.\n\n**Aquarium Puzzle Rules:**\n1.  **The Grid:** The grid is divided into several regions called \"tanks\" by the thick colored (red) lines.\n2.  **The Goal:** Your goal is to fill some cells in the grid with \"water\".\n3.  **Water Levels:** Within each tank, water must settle at a uniform level.

Understanding Tank Boundaries\nThe thick red lines define the boundaries of different tanks. There are three distinct tanks:\n- Top-left tank: cells (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (1,2), (2,2), (3,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3)\n- Top-right tank: cells (1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5)\n- Bottom-right tank: cells (4,4), (4,5), (5,4), (5,5)\n\n#### 2. Analyzing Row and Column Constraints\n\n- **Row 1 (0):** No cells should have water.\n- **Row 2 (3):** Three cells should have water.\n- **Row 3 (3):** Three cells should have water.\n- **Row 4 (4):** Four cells should have water.\n- **Row 5 (5):** All five cells should have water.\n\n- **Column 1 (4):** Four cells should have water.\n- **Column 2 (4):** Four cells should have water.\n- **Column 3 (4):** Four cells should have water.\n- **Column 4 (1):** One cell should have water.\n- **Column 5 (2):** Two cells should have water.\n\n#### 3. Filling Water While Respecting Tank Rules\n\n- For Row 1 (0), all cells will remain empty.\n- For Row 2 (3), within the top-left tank, the first three columns can have water. Hence, cells (2,1), (2,2), (2,3) will have water.\n- For Row 3 (3), similarly, cells (3,1), (3,2), (3,3) will have water.\n- For Row 4 (4), considering the constraints, cells (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), and one more cell either in column 4 or 5. Based on other rows and columns, let’s check further.\n- For Row 5 (5), all five cells will have water.\n\n#### 4. Verifying Columns\n\n- Column 1 (4): Cells (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1) have water - correct.\n- Column 2 (4): Cells (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), (5,2) have water - correct.\n- Column 3 (4): Cells (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3) have water - correct.\n- Column 4 (1): Either (4,4) or (5,4) should have water based on consistency with other rows - (4,4) seems consistent.\n- Column 5 (2): Cells (4,5) and (5,5) have water - correct.\n\n#### 5.
