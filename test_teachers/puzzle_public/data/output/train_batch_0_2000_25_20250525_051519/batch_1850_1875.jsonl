The sum of the digits in each horizontal block must equal the clue value for that block.\n    b. The sum of the digits in each vertical block must equal the clue value for that block.\n    (Note: No digit can be repeated within the same horizontal or vertical block, although this wasn't explicitly in the original Chinese, it's a standard Kakuro rule and crucial for solving. Adding it for clarity.)\n4. **Clues:** Clue cells display the required sum for the adjacent horizontal or vertical block of blank cells.\n5. **Solving:** Use logic to deduce the correct digit for each blank cell based on the clue values.\n\nYour task is to choose the correct grid configuration from the options below that represents the solution to the puzzle.Option A:\n```\n5 9 3 8\n6 8 5 3\n2 5 6 9\n3 4 1 7\n```\n\nOption B:\n```\n5 6 3 8\n6 8 5 3\n2 5 6 9\n5 4 9 7\n```\n\nOption C:\n```\n5 9 3 9\n6 8 5 3\n2 5 6 9\n3 8 1 7\n```\n\nOption D:\n```\n5 7 3 8\n6 8 5 3\n2 5 6 9\n3 4 1 7\n```\n\nPlease provide your answer as a single letter (A, B, C, or D) in \\boxed{} corresponding to the correct option.Let's think step by step:\n\n                                1.
