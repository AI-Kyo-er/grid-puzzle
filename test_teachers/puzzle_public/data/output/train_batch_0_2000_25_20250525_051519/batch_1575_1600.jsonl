{"question_id": "aquarium_9", "response": "Let's analyze this Aquarium puzzle step-by-step according to the given rules and clues.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the grid and tanks\n\n- The grid is divided into tanks using the red lines.\n- We have 4 rows and 4 columns with specified clues for each row and column.\n\n### Step 2: Examine the clues\n\n#### Row Clues:\n- Row 0: 0 (No cells filled)\n- Row 1: 0 (No cells filled)\n- Row 2: 2 (2 cells filled)\n- Row 3: 3 (3 cells filled)\n\n#### Column Clues:\n- Column 0: 0 (No cells filled)\n- Column 1: 1 (1 cell filled)\n- Column 2: 2 (2 cells filled)\n- Column 3: 2 (2 cells filled)\n\n### Step 3: Apply Logical Reasoning\n\n#### Analyze Columns First (simpler due to fewer tanks):\n- **Column 0**: No cells should be filled (clue = 0). \n    - Therefore, all cells in Column 0 will be empty.\n  \n- **Column 1**: Only one cell should be filled (clue = 1). \n    - There are two tanks in this column. The smaller tank has only one cell (row 3), so it must be filled. \n    - Hence, `Grid[3][1]` is 1, rest all are 0s.\n\n- **Column 2**: Two cells should be filled (clue = 2).\n    - There are two tanks in this column. The smaller tank can only hold 1 cell max. Thus, both cells of the larger tank must be filled.\n    - Hence, `Grid[2][2]` and `Grid[3][2]` are 1s.\n\n- **Column 3**: Two cells should be filled (clue = 2).\n    - There are three cells in the larger tank. Since clue is 2, exactly two cells from the bottom must be filled.\n    - Hence, `Grid[2][3]` and `Grid[3][3]` are 1s.\n\n#### Analyze Rows Next for consistency:\n- **Row 0**: No cells should be filled (clue = 0). \n    - All cells in Row 0 should be empty.\n\n- **Row 1**: No cells should be filled (clue = 0).\n    - All cells in Row 1 should be empty.\n\n- **Row 2**: Two cells should be filled (clue = 2).\n    - From earlier analysis, `Grid[2][2]` and `Grid[2][3]` are already filled, satisfying the clue.\n\n- **Row 3**: Three cells should be filled (clue = 3).\n    - From earlier analysis, `Grid[3][1]`, `Grid[3][2]`, and `Grid[3][3]` are already filled, satisfying the clue.\n\n### Step 4: Match the Grid Configuration with Options\n\nBased on our logical steps, the final configuration should be:\n```\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 1\n0 1 1 1\n```\nThis matches with Option C.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\[\n\\boxed{C}\n\\]", "ground_truth": "C", "prompt": "You need to solve an Aquarium puzzle.\n\n**Aquarium Puzzle Rules:**\n1.  **The Grid:** The grid is divided into several regions called \"tanks\" by the thick colored (red) lines.\n2.  **The Goal:** Your goal is to fill some cells in the grid with \"water\".\n3.  **Water Levels:** Within each tank, water must settle at a uniform level.

Since there is only one tank in this row, the water must fill up three consecutive cells starting from the bottom.\n   ```\n   0 1 1 1\n   ```\n\n3. **Row 2 (clue: 4)** - Four cells must have water.

{"question_id": "aquarium_100", "response": "To solve this Aquarium puzzle, we'll analyze the grid and the given clues while adhering to the water-level rules. Let’s break it down step-by-step:\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Clues\n\n- **Top Row Clues (Columns):** `4, 4, 1, 1`\n- **Left Side Clues (Rows):** `2, 2, 2, 4`\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing Tank Constraints\n\n#### Tank 1 (Top Left):\n- **Clue at Top:** 4 (Column 1)\n- **Clue at Left:** 2 (Row 1)\n\nThis tank has 4 columns and 2 rows. To satisfy both clues, this entire tank should be filled up to the second row.\n\n#### Tank 2 (Top Middle):\n- **Clue at Top:** 4 (Column 2)\n- **Clue at Left:** 2 (Row 1)\n\nSimilar to Tank 1 but in the middle section. It should also be filled up to the second row.\n\n#### Tank 3 (Top Right):\n- **Clue at Top:** 1 (Column 3) and 1 (Column 4)\n- **Clue at Left:** 2 (Row 1)\n\nThis tank spans two columns and two rows. For these clues, only one cell per column needs to be filled in the first row.\n\n#### Tank 4 (Bottom Left):\n- **Clue at Top:** 4 (Column 1)\n- **Clue at Left:** 4 (Row 4)\n\nThis tank fills entirely because it satisfies both horizontal and vertical clues.\n\n#### Tank 5 (Bottom Right):\n- **Clue at Top:** 1 (Column 3) and 1 (Column 4)\n- **Clue at Left:** 2 (Row 2), 2 (Row 3)\n\nThis tank should have one cell filled for the topmost row (row 2) and another for the next row (row 3).\n\n### Step 3: Filling the Grid Based on Analysis\n\nBased on the analysis, let's build our grid:\n\n```\n1 1 0 0\n1 1 0 0\n1 1 1 0\n1 1 1 1\n```\n\n### Step 4: Verifying Against Options\n\n- **Option A:**\n  ```\n  1 1 0 0\n  1 1 0 0\n  1 1 1 0\n  1 1 1 1\n  ```\n\n- **Option B:**\n  ```\n  1 1 0 0\n  1 1 0 0\n  1 1 0 0\n  1 1 1 1\n  ```\n\n- **Option C:**\n  ```\n  1 1 1 0\n  1 1 0 1\n  1 1 0 0\n  1 1 1 1\n  ```\n\n- **Option D:**\n  ```\n  1 1 0 0\n  0 1 0 0\n  1 1 0 1\n  1 1 1 1\n  ```\n\n### Final Answer\n\nOption A matches the logical deductions correctly following all the rules and clues:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{A}\n\\]", "ground_truth": "B", "prompt": "You need to solve an Aquarium puzzle.\n\n**Aquarium Puzzle Rules:**\n1.  **The Grid:** The grid is divided into several regions called \"tanks\" by the thick colored (red) lines.\n2.  **The Goal:** Your goal is to fill some cells in the grid with \"water\".\n3.  **Water Levels:** Within each tank, water must settle at a uniform level.
