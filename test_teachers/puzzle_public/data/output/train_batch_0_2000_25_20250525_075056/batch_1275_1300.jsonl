{"question_id": "aquarium_213", "response": "To solve this Aquarium puzzle, we'll follow the given rules and clues step by step.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n#### Step 1: Analyze the tanks and their constraints\n\nThere are three distinct tanks formed by the red lines:\n1. The first tank spans columns 1-2 and rows 1-5.\n2. The second tank spans columns 3-4 and rows 1-5.\n3. The third tank spans only column 5 and rows 1-5.\n\n#### Step 2: Apply the clue for column 1 (clue = 1)\n\n- Column 1 must have exactly one cell filled with water.\n- Since water settles at a uniform level, the only possible cell to fill in column 1 is the bottom cell (row 5), as filling any other cell would require more than one cell to be filled, violating the clue.\n\nSo, the cell (1,5) should be filled with water.\n\n#### Step 3: Apply the clue for column 2 (clue = 2)\n\n- Column 2 must have exactly two cells filled with water.\n- Again, due to the uniform water level rule, these two cells must be consecutive starting from the bottom.\n- Therefore, cells (2,4) and (2,5) should be filled with water.\n\n#### Step 4: Apply the clue for column 3 (clue = 3)\n\n- Column 3 must have exactly three cells filled with water.\n- Following the uniform water level rule, these three cells must be the bottom three cells.\n- Therefore, cells (3,3), (3,4), and (3,5) should be filled with water.\n\n#### Step 5: Apply the clue for column 4 (clue = 4)\n\n- Column 4 must have exactly four cells filled with water.\n- These four cells must be the bottom four cells.\n- Therefore, cells (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), and (4,5) should be filled with water.\n\n#### Step 6: Apply the clue for column 5 (clue = 4)\n\n- Column 5 must have exactly four cells filled with water.\n- These four cells must be the bottom four cells.\n- Therefore, cells (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), and (5,5) should be filled with water.\n\n#### Step 7: Check the row clues\n\n- Row 0 has no clue; thus, no cells are filled.\n- Row 1 has no clue; thus, no cells are filled.\n- Row 2 has a clue of 2; cells (4,2) and (5,2) satisfy this.\n- Row 3 has a clue of 3; cells (3,3), (4,3), and (5,3) satisfy this.\n- Row 4 has a clue of 4; cells (3,4), (4,4), (5,4) satisfy this.\n- Row 5 has a clue of 5; cells (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5) satisfy this.\n\nAll clues are now satisfied.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nComparing the final state of the grid with the provided options, the correct configuration matches Option C:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{C}\n\\]", "ground_truth": "C", "prompt": "You need to solve an Aquarium puzzle.\n\n**Aquarium Puzzle Rules:**\n1.  **The Grid:** The grid is divided into several regions called \"tanks\" by the thick colored (red) lines.\n2.  **The Goal:** Your goal is to fill some cells in the grid with \"water\".\n3.  **Water Levels:** Within each tank, water must settle at a uniform level.
