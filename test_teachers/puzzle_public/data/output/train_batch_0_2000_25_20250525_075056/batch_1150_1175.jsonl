{"question_id": "binairo_606", "response": "To solve this Binairo puzzle, we will follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Understand Initial Configuration\nGiven the initial configuration:\n- Red squares = 1\n- Blue squares = 0\n\nSo the initial grid looks like this:\n```\n? 1 ? ?\n0 ? ? ?\n? ? ? 1\n? ? 0 0\n```\n\n### Step 2: Apply Rule 3 - Equal Number of 0s and 1s per Row and Column\nEach row and column should have exactly two 0s and two 1s.\n\n### Step 3: Fill in the Grid Based on Rules\n#### Row 1:\n- Already has one '1' at position (1, 2)\n- Needs one more '1' and two '0's\n- The first '0' cannot be placed at (1, 1) because it would violate the two-consecutive rule with the '0' already in position (2, 1).\n\nSo, let's try:\n```\n0 1 1 0\n0 ? ? ?\n? ? ? 1\n? ? 0 0\n```\n\n#### Row 2:\n- Already has one '0' at position (2, 1)\n- Needs one more '0' and two '1's\n- The remaining cells should be filled such that there are no three consecutive identical digits.\n\nSo, let's try:\n```\n0 1 1 0\n0 0 1 1\n? ? ? 1\n? ? 0 0\n```\n\n#### Row 3:\n- Needs two '0's and two '1's\n- The last digit is '1', so the other '1' must be placed to keep the balance and avoid three consecutive identical digits.\n\nSo, let's try:\n```\n0 1 1 0\n0 0 1 1\n1 0 0 1\n? ? 0 0\n```\n\n#### Row 4:\n- Already has two '0's at positions (4, 3) and (4, 4)\n- Needs two '1's\n\nSo, let's fill them in:\n```\n0 1 1 0\n0 0 1 1\n1 0 0 1\n1 1 0 0\n```\n\n### Step 4: Verify Solution Against All Rules\n1.
