{"question_id": "aquarium_72", "response": "To solve this Aquarium puzzle, we will go through the process step-by-step for each row and column.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n#### Step 1: Analyze the Top Row Clues\n\n- The first row clue is '1'. This means only one cell in the entire first row should be filled with water. We have four cells in this row spread across two tanks.\n\n    - The rightmost tank has 4 cells, but filling any of them would require filling all 4 cells due to the water level rule. Therefore, no cell can be filled in this tank.\n    - The leftmost tank has 3 cells, so the only possible way to satisfy the '1' clue is to fill the bottom cell of the leftmost tank.\n\nSo, the first row should look like `[0 0 0 1]`.\n\n#### Step 2: Analyze the Second Row Clue\n\n- The second row clue is '3'. This means three cells in the entire second row should be filled with water.\n\n    - The row spans two tanks: one with 3 cells on the left and one with 4 cells on the right.\n    - The only way to fill exactly three cells while maintaining water levels within tanks is to fill the bottom two cells of the left tank and the top cell of the right tank.\n\nSo, the second row should look like `[0 1 1 1]`.\n\n#### Step 3: Analyze the Third Row Clue\n\n- The third row clue is '4'. This means all four cells in the entire third row should be filled with water.\n\n    - Both tanks in this row must be completely filled since there are no other possibilities.\n\nSo, the third row should look like `[1 1 1 1]`.\n\n#### Step 4: Analyze the Fourth Row Clue\n\n- The fourth row clue is '4'. This means all four cells in the entire fourth row should be filled with water.\n\n    - Both tanks in this row must be completely filled since there are no other possibilities.\n\nSo, the fourth row should look like `[1 1 1 1]`.\n\n### Step 5: Verify the Configuration\n\nPutting all the rows together, the final grid should look like:\n\n```\n0 0 0 1\n0 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1\n```\n\nThis matches Option D.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is \\boxed{D}.", "ground_truth": "D", "prompt": "You need to solve an Aquarium puzzle.\n\n**Aquarium Puzzle Rules:**\n1.  **The Grid:** The grid is divided into several regions called \"tanks\" by the thick colored (red) lines.\n2.  **The Goal:** Your goal is to fill some cells in the grid with \"water\".\n3.  **Water Levels:** Within each tank, water must settle at a uniform level.
