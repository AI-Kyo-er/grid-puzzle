{"question_id": "aquarium_198", "response": "To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the grid step by step, using the clues provided and the rules of the Aquarium puzzle:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze Column and Row Clues\n- Top row has 3 filled cells in the first two columns.\n- Second row has 2 filled cells.\n- Third row has 3 filled cells.\n- Fourth row has 3 filled cells.\n\n- Leftmost column has 0 filled cells.\n- Second column has 3 filled cells.\n- Third column has 0 filled cells.\n- Fourth column has 2 filled cells.\n\n### Step 2: Filling Cells Based on Clues\n\n#### First Row Analysis:\n- The first row needs 3 filled cells. There are only two tanks in this row. The only way to satisfy this is by filling both cells in the first tank and leaving the second tank empty since its clue is 0.\n\n```\n0 | 1 1 | 0 | 0\n```\n\n#### Second Row Analysis:\n- The second row needs 2 filled cells. The first tank has one cell already filled from above, so we need one more. The second tank can't have any filled cells as the column clue for the third column is 0.\n\n```\n0 | 1 1 | 0 | 0\n1 | 1   | 0 | 0\n```\n\n#### Third Row Analysis:\n- The third row needs 3 filled cells. The first tank is already partially filled from above. We need to fill the remaining two cells in this tank and one in the next tank because the fourth column needs 2 filled cells.\n\n```\n0 | 1 1 | 0 | 0\n1 | 1   | 0 | 0\n1 | 1   | 0 | 1\n```\n\n#### Fourth Row Analysis:\n- The fourth row needs 3 filled cells. The first tank is already partially filled from above. We need to fill the remaining two cells in this tank and one in the next tank because the fourth column needs 2 filled cells.\n\n```\n0 | 1 1 | 0 | 0\n1 | 1   | 0 | 0\n1 | 1   | 0 | 1\n1 | 1   | 0 | 1\n```\n\n### Final Configuration:\nAfter filling the cells according to the rules and clues, the final grid should look like this:\n\n```\n0 0 0 0\n1 1 0 0\n1 1 0 1\n1 1 0 1\n```\n\nThis matches Option C.
