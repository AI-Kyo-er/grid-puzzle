Therefore, the only possible way is to have the first cell (`2`) and both cells in the last two columns filled with water.\n   - So, the fourth row should look like: `0 0 1 1 1`.\n\n3. **Fifth row** (marked `5`):\n   - All five cells in this row must be filled with water because the clue is `5`.\n   - Therefore, the fifth row should look like: `1 1 1 1 1`.\n\nGiven the above analysis, let's check the options that match our derived rows:\n\n- Option A:\n```\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1\n```\n- Option B:\n```\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 1 0\n1 1 1 1 1\n```\n- Option C:\n```\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 1 1\n1 1 0 1 1\n```\n- Option D:\n```\n0 1 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 1 0 0 0\n0 0 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1\n```\n\nClearly, the only option that matches our derived rows is Option A.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is \\boxed{A}.", "ground_truth": "A", "prompt": "You need to solve an Aquarium puzzle.\n\n**Aquarium Puzzle Rules:**\n1.  **The Grid:** The grid is divided into several regions called \"tanks\" by the thick colored (red) lines.\n2.  **The Goal:** Your goal is to fill some cells in the grid with \"water\".\n3.  **Water Levels:** Within each tank, water must settle at a uniform level.

{"question_id": "binairo_702", "response": "To solve this Binairo puzzle, let's follow these steps systematically:\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Constraints\n1. Each cell must be filled with either a 0 or a 1.\n2. No more than two consecutive identical numbers in any row or column.\n3. Each row and column must have an equal number of 0s and 1s.\n4.

The rest of the row needs 3 cells with 2 '1's and 1 '0'.\n- To avoid three consecutive '1's, valid combinations could be `0101`, `0110`.\n\n#### Column 2:\n- Already has '0' and '1'. Needs two more cells to balance it out with equal '0's and '1's.\n- Valid configurations while avoiding three consecutive '1's would be `_1` or `1_`.\n\n#### Column 3:\n- Already has two '1's. Hence, other two cells should both be '0'.\n\n#### Column 4:\n- Needs two '0's and two '1's. Avoiding three consecutive numbers and balancing, it can be `_1` or `1_`.\n\n### Step 4: Verify Against Options\nWe will verify each of the given options to see if they satisfy all the rules.\n\n#### Option A:\n```\n0 1 0 1\n0 1 1 0\n1 0 1 0\n1 0 0 1\n```\n- Check for consecutive identical numbers: All rows and columns meet the criteria.\n- Equal count of '0's and '1's in each row/column: Yes.\n- No two rows or columns are identical: Yes.\n\n#### Option B:\n```\n1 1 0 1\n0 1 1 0\n1 0 1 0\n1 0 0 1\n```\n- Invalid since first row starts with two '1's consecutively.\n\n#### Option C:\n```\n0 1 0 1\n0 1 1 0\n1 0 0 0\n1 0 0 1\n```\n- Invalid since third row has three '0's.\n\n#### Option D:\n```\n0 1 0 1\n0 1 1 0\n1 0 1 0\n1 0 0 0\n```\n- Invalid since fourth row ends with two '0's consecutively.\n\n### Final Conclusion:\nOption A satisfies all the given rules of the Binairo puzzle.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{A}\n\\]", "ground_truth": "A", "prompt": "You need to solve a Binairo puzzle.\n\n**Binairo Puzzle Rules:**\n1.
