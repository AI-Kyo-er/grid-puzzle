We'll check if any option violates the constraints (rows, columns, and 3x3 subgrids containing each number from 1-9 exactly once).\n\nLet's start checking Option A:\n\n**Option A:**\n\n```\n7 2 8 4 3 9 5 6 1\n4 5 1 2 8 6 9 3 7\n9 6 3 1 7 5 8 4 2\n8 9 7 3 6 2 1 5 8\n5 4 2 8 1 7 6 9 3\n3 1 6 5 9 4 7 2 8\n2 8 5 9 4 1 3 7 6\n1 7 9 3 2 3 4 8 5\n6 3 4 7 5 5 2 1 9\n```\n\nWe see that the 5th row has two '6's and the last row has two '5's. Thus, Option A is invalid.\n\n\n**Option B:**\n\n```\n7 2 8 4 3 9 5 6 1\n4 5 1 2 8 6 9 3 7\n9 6 3 1 7 5 8 4 2\n8 9 7 3 6 2 1 5 4\n5 4 2 8 1 7 6 9 3\n3 1 6 5 9 4 7 2 8\n8 8 5 9 4 1 3 7 6\n1 7 9 6 2 3 4 8 5\n6 3 4 7 5 8 2 1 9\n```\nWe can observe that the 7th row has two '8's. So Option B is invalid too.\n\n\n**Option C:**\n\n```\n7 2 8 2 3 9 5 6 1\n4 5 1 2 8 6 9 3 7\n9 6 3 1 7 5 8 4 2\n8 9 7 3 6 2 1 5 4\n5 4 2 8 1 7 6 9 3\n3 1 6 5 9 4 7 2 8\n2 8 5 9 4 1 3 7 6\n1 7 9 6 2 3 4 8 5\n6 3 4 7 5 6 2 1 9\n```\nWe can easily spot that first row has two '2's. So Option C is also invalid.\n\n\n**Option D:**\n\n```\n7 2 8 4 3 9 5 6 1\n4 5 1 2 8 6 9 3 7\n9 6 3 1 7 5 8 4 2\n8 9 7 3 6 2 1 5 4\n5 4 2 8 1 7 6 9 3\n3 1 6 5 9 4 7 2 8\n2 8 5 9 4 1 3 7 6\n1 7 9 6 2 3 4 8 5\n6 3 4 7 5 8 2 1 9\n```\nThis option does not violate any constraints when compared to the original values and following the Sudoku rules. \n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\\boxed{D}", "ground_truth": "D", "prompt": "You need to solve a Sudoku puzzle of size 9x9.\n\n**Sudoku Puzzle Rules (9x9 grid):**\n1.  **The Grid:** The grid is a 9x9 square, further divided into each 3x3 subgrid (non-overlapping regions).\n2.  **The Goal:** Fill all empty cells in the grid with digits from 1 to 9.\n3.  **Constraints:** Each digit (1 to 9) must appear exactly once in:\n    a.
