Row 3 (5): All five cells should be filled with water.\n5. Row 4 (5): All five cells should be filled with water.\n\n#### Column Clues Analysis\n\n1. Column 0 (2): Two cells should be filled with water.\n2. Column 1 (3): Three cells should be filled with water.\n3. Column 2 (4): Four cells should be filled with water.\n4.
