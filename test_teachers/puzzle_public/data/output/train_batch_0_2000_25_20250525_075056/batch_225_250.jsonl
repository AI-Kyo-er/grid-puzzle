{"question_id": "kakuro_127", "response": "Let's solve the Kakuro puzzle step by step.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n#### 1. Analyze the clues provided:\n\n- The top row has the following clues:\n  - 22 for three cells horizontally.\n  - 16 for two cells horizontally.\n  - 17 for two cells horizontally.\n\n- The left column has the following clues:\n  - 16 for two cells vertically.\n  - 18 for three cells vertically.\n  - 21 for three cells vertically.\n\n#### 2. Determine possibilities for sums:\n- **Top Row Sums:**\n  - For a sum of 22 with three unique digits (1-9), possible combinations are: \n    - {9, 8, 5}\n    - {9, 7, 6}\n    \n  - For a sum of 16 with two unique digits (1-9):\n    - Possible combinations are {9, 7}, {8, 8} (but no repetition allowed), so only {9, 7}.\n  \n  - For a sum of 17 with two unique digits (1-9):\n    - Possible combinations are {9, 8}\n\n- **Left Column Sums:**\n  - For a sum of 16 with two unique digits (1-9):\n    - Possible combinations are {9, 7}\n  \n  - For a sum of 18 with three unique digits (1-9):\n    - Possible combinations are {9, 8, 1}, {9, 7, 2}, {9, 6, 3}, {9, 5, 4}, {8, 7, 3}, etc.\n  \n  - For a sum of 21 with three unique digits (1-9):\n    - Possible combinations are {9, 8, 4}, {9, 7, 5}, {9, 6, 6} (no repetition), {8, 7, 6}\n\n#### 3. Filling the grid using logical deduction:\n\nLet's start filling the grid based on the above constraints and eliminate invalid options:\n\n- **Top Row:**\n  - The first cell should be `9` because `9` is common in multiple combinations.\n  - The second cell must be `3` to satisfy 22 = 9 + 3 + 4.\n  - The third cell must be `4`.\n  \n- **Left Column:**\n  - The first cell should be `9` again (as seen).\n  - The second cell should be `7` to satisfy 16 = 9 + 7.\n  - The third cell should be `5` to satisfy 17 = 9 + 8.\n  \n- **Middle Row:**\n  - Sum 16 can be satisfied by `7` and `9`. The first cell is `7`.\n\nFinally fill the remaining cells with valid digits ensuring no repetition per row and column.\n\n#### 4.
