{"question_id": "binairo_618", "response": "To solve this Binairo puzzle, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Initial Configuration:**\n   - The blue square at the top-left corner indicates a `0`.\n   - The red squares indicate `1`s. So, the grid starts as:\n     ```\n     0 _ _ _\n     _ 1 1 _\n     _ _ _ _\n     _ _ 1 _\n     ```\n\n2. **Apply Rule 3 (Equal Number of 0s and 1s):**\n   - Since there are 4 cells in each row and column, there must be exactly 2 `0`s and 2 `1`s in each row and column.\n\n3. **Apply Rule 2 (No More Than Two Consecutive Identical Numbers):**\n   - In the second row, since it already has `1 1`, the remaining two cells must be `0` but cannot be consecutive. Thus, the only way is:\n     ```\n     0 1 1 0\n     ```\n\n4. **Complete the First Row:**\n   - We have `0 _ _ _`. Avoiding consecutive `1`s and having an equal number of `0`s and `1`s, it should be:\n     ```\n     0 1 0 1\n     ```\n\n5. **Complete the Fourth Row:**\n   - We have `_ _ 1 _`. To satisfy the rule of no identical rows and columns while maintaining `2 0`s and `2 1`s, the possible valid combination is:\n     ```\n     1 0 1 0\n     ```\n\n6. **Complete the Third Row:**\n   - With the above rows placed, we have:\n     ```\n     0 1 0 1\n     0 1 1 0\n     _ _ _ _\n     1 0 1 0\n     ```\n   - The third row should avoid identical rows and columns while also maintaining the count and sequence rules:\n     ```\n     1 0 0 1\n     ```\n\n7. **Verify the Full Grid:**\n   - The complete grid now stands as:\n     ```\n     0 1 0 1\n     0 1 1 0\n     1 0 0 1\n     1 0 1 0\n     ```\n   - This matches Option A.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\\boxed{A}", "ground_truth": "A", "prompt": "You need to solve a Binairo puzzle.\n\n**Binairo Puzzle Rules:**\n1.
