Therefore, no cells in this row should be filled.\n- **Row 2**: Has a clue of 2. So two cells in this row should be filled.\n- **Row 4**: Has two clues of 4. So all four cells in these rows should be filled.\n\n#### Step 3: Analyze Column Constraints\n- **Column 0**: Has a clue of 3. So three cells in this column should be filled.\n- **Column 1**: Has a clue of 2. So two cells in this column should be filled.\n- **Column 2**: Has a clue of 2. So two cells in this column should be filled.\n- **Column 3**: Has a clue of 3. So three cells in this column should be filled.\n\n#### Step 4: Fill Cells While Maintaining Uniform Water Level\n- Start filling according to the row and column constraints while making sure water settles uniformly in each tank.\n\n##### Filling Row 0\n- Since the clue is 0, no cells are filled.\n\n##### Filling Row 2\n- Needs 2 cells filled. Check possible configurations:\n    - If we fill the leftmost cell in this row, the entire leftmost column (up to row 4) must be filled too, but that violates the column constraint of having only 3 cells filled in the first column.\n    - Thus, the filled cells should be towards the right end.\n  \n##### Filling Row 4\n- All cells in this row must be filled.\n\n##### Filling Columns\n- Column 0 needs 3 filled cells. From our earlier deduction, they can be in rows 2, 3, and 4.\n- Column 1 needs 2 filled cells. They could be in rows 2 and 4.\n- Column 2 needs 2 filled cells.

{"question_id": "aquarium_681", "response": "To solve the given Aquarium puzzle and determine which option correctly fills the grid with water while adhering to the rules, let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n#### 1. Understand Tank Divisions:\nThe red lines divide the grid into four tanks. These tanks can have different water levels but must follow the uniform water level rule within each individual tank.\n\n#### 2. Analyze Row and Column Hints:\n- **Column Hints**: From left to right, we have hints: 1, 2, 2, 1.\n- **Row Hints**: From top to bottom, we have hints: 0, 0, 2, 4.\n\n#### 3. Solve Row by Row:\n\n##### Row 1 (Hint = 0):\n- All cells should be empty because no water is allowed in this row.\n\n##### Row 2 (Hint = 0):\n- All cells should be empty since there’s no water required for this row.\n\n##### Row 3 (Hint = 2):\n- We must fill exactly 2 cells. Note that the water must fill uniformly inside any tank. This row has two tanks: one of width 2 and another of width 2.\n- Fill the tank on the left side fully to satisfy the hint of 2. Thus, it will look like `0 1 1 0`.\n\n##### Row 4 (Hint = 4):\n- Fill all 4 cells with water to satisfy the hint. Thus, it will look like `1 1 1 1`.\n\n#### 4. Verify the Solution:\nNow, verify the solution using the column hints:\n\n- **Column 1**: Should have a total of 1 filled cell. From our analysis, only the last row satisfies this.\n- **Column 2**: Should have a total of 2 filled cells. From our analysis, rows 3 and 4 together satisfy this.\n- **Column 3**: Should have a total of 2 filled cells. Rows 3 and 4 together satisfy this.\n- **Column 4**: Should have a total of 1 filled cell. Only the last row satisfies this.\n\nThis matches Option D completely.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\[\n\\boxed{D}\n\\]", "ground_truth": "D", "prompt": "You need to solve an Aquarium puzzle.\n\n**Aquarium Puzzle Rules:**\n1.  **The Grid:** The grid is divided into several regions called \"tanks\" by the thick colored (red) lines.\n2.  **The Goal:** Your goal is to fill some cells in the grid with \"water\".\n3.  **Water Levels:** Within each tank, water must settle at a uniform level.
