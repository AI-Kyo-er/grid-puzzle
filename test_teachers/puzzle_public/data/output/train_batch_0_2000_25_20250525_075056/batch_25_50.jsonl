{"question_id": "aquarium_192", "response": "To solve the Aquarium puzzle, let's analyze each row and column based on the given clues and the rules:\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n#### Row Analysis:\n\n1. **Row 0 (top row):** Clue = 0\n   - This row should have no water. Therefore, all cells in this row will be empty (`0`).\n\n2. **Row 1:** Clue = 3\n   - There are 4 cells in this row, and 3 of them need to be filled with water.\n   - The red line divides this row into two tanks: one with 2 cells on the left and another with 2 cells on the right.\n   - If we fill the first tank completely (2 cells), we still need to fill 1 more cell in the second tank. Since water must settle uniformly within each tank, the second tank cannot be partially filled. Thus, we must fill only the second tank completely, which satisfies the clue of 3 cells.\n\n   So, the configuration for Row 1 is `0 1 1 1`.\n\n3. **Row 2:** Clue = 4\n   - All 4 cells in this row need to be filled with water. Both tanks in this row will be completely filled.\n\n   So, the configuration for Row 2 is `1 1 1 1`.\n\n4. **Row 3:** Clue = 4\n   - Similar to Row 2, all 4 cells in this row need to be filled with water. Both tanks in this row will be completely filled.\n\n   So, the configuration for Row 3 is `1 1 1 1`.\n\n### Column Analysis:\n\n1. **Column 0:** Clue = 2\n   - We already filled 2 cells in this column (Row 2 and Row 3). This satisfies the clue.\n\n2. **Column 1:** Clue = 3\n   - We filled 3 cells in this column (Row 1, Row 2, and Row 3). This satisfies the clue.\n\n3. **Column 2:** Clue = 3\n   - We filled 3 cells in this column (Row 1, Row 2, and Row 3). This satisfies the clue.\n\n4. **Column 3:** Clue = 3\n   - We filled 3 cells in this column (Row 1, Row 2, and Row 3). This satisfies the clue.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nAfter analyzing both rows and columns, the correct grid configuration is:\n```\n0 0 0 0\n0 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1\n```\n\nThis matches Option A.\n\nThus, the correct option is \\boxed{A}.", "ground_truth": "A", "prompt": "You need to solve an Aquarium puzzle.\n\n**Aquarium Puzzle Rules:**\n1.  **The Grid:** The grid is divided into several regions called \"tanks\" by the thick colored (red) lines.\n2.  **The Goal:** Your goal is to fill some cells in the grid with \"water\".\n3.  **Water Levels:** Within each tank, water must settle at a uniform level.

{"question_id": "aquarium_159", "response": "To solve the Aquarium puzzle for this grid, we'll start by analyzing the given numbers along the top and left sides of the grid.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n#### Row Constraints:\n- Rows 0 and 1 have no filled cells (0s).\n- Rows 2, 3, and 4 have 1, 2, and 3 filled cells respectively.\n\n#### Column Constraints:\n- Columns 0 and 1 have no filled cells (0s).\n- Columns 2, 3, 4, and 5 have 1, 4, 3, and 2 filled cells respectively.\n\n#### Tank Constraints:\nEach tank must have a uniform water level. We'll use the numbers as guides while ensuring each section follows the water level rule.\n\n### Applying the Constraints\n\n#### Step 1: Row 0 and 1\nBoth rows have a constraint of 0, so they remain empty.\n\n```\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n```\n\n#### Step 2: Row 2\nRow 2 has a constraint of 1. There is only one possible tank here, and it can only be filled up to 1 cell in column 3.\n\n```\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 1 0 0\n```\n\n#### Step 3: Row 3\nRow 3 has a constraint of 2. This is a larger tank spanning columns 3, 4, and 5. It needs 2 cells filled uniformly within the tank.\n\n```\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 1 1 1 0\n```\n\n#### Step 4: Row 4\nRow 4 has a constraint of 3. This again covers the large tank from columns 3 to 5. It requires 3 cells filled uniformly within the tank.\n\n```\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 1 1 1 0\n0 0 0 1 1 1\n```\n\n#### Step 5: Check Column Constraints\nColumns 0 and 1 already match their constraints (0). For columns 2, 3, 4, and 5, the number of filled cells should be 1, 4, 3, and 2 respectively. To meet these constraints, the last remaining cell in the second tank should be filled in the last row.\n\n```\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 1 1 1 0\n0 0 0 1 1 1\n0 0 1 1 1 1\n```\n\n### Verification\nThis solution matches all given constraints and follows the uniform water level rule within each tank.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe correct configuration matching our analysis is Option A.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{A}\n\\]", "ground_truth": "B", "prompt": "You need to solve an Aquarium puzzle.\n\n**Aquarium Puzzle Rules:**\n1.  **The Grid:** The grid is divided into several regions called \"tanks\" by the thick colored (red) lines.\n2.  **The Goal:** Your goal is to fill some cells in the grid with \"water\".\n3.  **Water Levels:** Within each tank, water must settle at a uniform level.

Check Row and Column Clues:\n- Consider rows first:\n    - Row 1 has one filled cell.\n    - Row 2 has three filled cells.\n    - Row 3 has four filled cells.\n    - Row 4 has four filled cells.\n- Then consider columns:\n    - Column 1 has two filled cells.\n    - Column 2 has three filled cells.\n    - Column 3 has three filled cells.\n    - Column 4 has four filled cells.\n\n#### 3. Filling the Grid Based on Clues:\n- **Row 1:**\n  - Only one cell can be filled.
