Our task is to find the correct completed grid among four options (A, B, C, D).\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Given Sudoku Grid\n\nHere's the starting grid provided:\n\n```plaintext\n|   |   |   | 8 | 3 |   |   |   | 5 |\n|   |   |   |   |   |   |   | 8 |   |\n|   | 6 | 1 |   | 7 | 5 |   | 3 | 9 |\n-----------------------------\n|   | 3 | 2 |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n|   | 8 |   | 9 |   | 1 |   |   | 2 |\n| 9 |   | 6 | 5 | 8 | 2 |   |   | 3 |\n-----------------------------\n| 2 | 1 |   | 3 |   |   |   | 7 | 4 |\n|   |   | 5 |   | 2 |   |   |   | 1 |\n| 3 |   | 4 |   |   |   |   | 2 | 6 |\n```\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate Each Option\n\nWe will check each option against the Sudoku rules. \n\n#### Option A:\n```plaintext\n7 2 9 8 4 3 1 6 5\n4 5 3 6 1 9 2 8 7\n8 6 1 2 7 5 4 3 9\n7 3 2 7 6 4 9 5 8\n5 8 7 9 3 1 6 2 2\n9 4 6 5 8 2 7 1 3\n2 1 8 3 9 6 5 7 4\n6 7 5 4 9 8 3 9 1\n3 9 4 1 5 7 8 2 6\n```\n\n- The number '7' appears twice in the fifth row.\n- Thus, Option A is incorrect.\n\n#### Option B:\n```plaintext\n7 2 9 8 4 3 1 6 5\n4 5 3 6 1 9 2 8 7\n8 6 1 2 7 5 4 3 9\n1 3 2 7 6 4 9 5 8\n5 4 7 9 3 1 6 4 2\n9 4 6 5 8 2 7 1 3\n2 1 8 3 9 6 5 7 4\n6 7 5 4 2 8 3 9 1\n3 9 4 1 5 7 8 2 6\n```\n\n- The number '4' appears twice in the fifth row.\n- Thus, Option B is incorrect.\n\n#### Option C:\n```plaintext\n7 2 9 8 4 3 1 6 5\n4 5 3 6 1 9 2 8 7\n8 6 1 2 7 5 4 3 9\n1 3 2 7 6 4 9 5 8\n5 8 7 9 3 1 6 4 1\n9 4 6 5 8 2 7 1 3\n2 1 8 3 9 6 5 7 4\n6 7 5 4 2 8 3 9 1\n3 9 4 1 5 7 2 2 6\n```\n\n- The number '1' appears twice in the fifth row.\n- Thus, Option C is incorrect.\n\n#### Option D:\n```plaintext\n7 2 9 8 4 3 1 6 5\n4 5 3 6 1 9 2 8 7\n8 6 1 2 7 5 4 3 9\n1 3 2 7 6 4 9 5 8\n5 8 7 9 3 1 6 4 2\n9 4 6 5 8 2 7 1 3\n2 1 8 3 9 6 5 7 4\n6 7 5 4 2 8 3 9 1\n3 9 4 1 5 7 8 2 6\n```\n\n- All rows, columns, and 3x3 subgrids are checked and no duplicates are found.\n- Thus, Option D satisfies all Sudoku rules.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{D}", "ground_truth": "D", "prompt": "You need to solve a Sudoku puzzle of size 9x9.\n\n**Sudoku Puzzle Rules (9x9 grid):**\n1.  **The Grid:** The grid is a 9x9 square, further divided into each 3x3 subgrid (non-overlapping regions).\n2.  **The Goal:** Fill all empty cells in the grid with digits from 1 to 9.\n3.  **Constraints:** Each digit (1 to 9) must appear exactly once in:\n    a.
