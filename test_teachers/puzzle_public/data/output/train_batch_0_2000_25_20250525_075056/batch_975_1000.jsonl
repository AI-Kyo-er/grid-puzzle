{"question_id": "aquarium_181", "response": "To solve the Aquarium puzzle, we'll follow the rules and clues step by step.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n#### Step 1: Understand the Tanks and Clues\n\nThere are five tanks in the grid separated by red lines:\n1. Top-left tank (3x2)\n2. Middle-left tank (1x2)\n3. Middle-right tank (2x3)\n4. Bottom-left tank (2x2)\n5. Bottom-right tank (3x2)\n\nThe row and column clues are:\n- Rows: 0, 1, 2, 2, 5\n- Columns: 3, 4, 1, 1, 1\n\n#### Step 2: Analyze Each Tank Based on Clues\n\n##### Top-left tank (3x2):\n- Column 1 has a clue of 3, so the entire first column must be filled up to two rows (since there are only two rows in this tank).\n- Column 2 has a clue of 4 but spans more than one tank. We can't fill this column completely yet.\n\n##### Middle-left tank (1x2):\n- Row 2 has a clue of 1, meaning one cell must be filled. Since it’s a single-cell tank, both cells cannot be filled simultaneously. So we fill the leftmost cell of this row.\n\n##### Middle-right tank (2x3):\n- Column 3 has a clue of 1. This means exactly one cell in this column should be filled. Given the tank height is 2, it will fill the bottom cell of this column in this tank.\n- Column 4 has a clue of 1. Following similar logic, it will fill the bottom cell of this column in this tank.\n\n##### Bottom-left tank (2x2):\n- Row 4 has a clue of 2. Both cells in this row of this tank must be filled.\n- Row 5 has a clue of 5, which means both columns of this tank must be filled fully (both cells in the first and second column).\n\n##### Bottom-right tank (3x2):\n- Column 5 has a clue of 1. So, only the bottom cell of this column needs to be filled.\n\n#### Step 3: Verify and Fill the Grid\n\nUsing these deductions, let's fill the grid:\n\n```\n0 0 0 0 0   # Top-left cell empty as it doesn’t satisfy any immediate constraints.\n0 1 0 0 0   # Middle-left cell filled based on row clue.\n1 1 0 0 0   # Top-left tank filled vertically as per column clue.\n1 1 0 0 0   # Same as above.\n1 1 1 1 1   # Bottom tank filled as per row and column clues.\n```\n\nThis matches Option A perfectly.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\[\n\\boxed{A}\n\\]", "ground_truth": "A", "prompt": "You need to solve an Aquarium puzzle.\n\n**Aquarium Puzzle Rules:**\n1.  **The Grid:** The grid is divided into several regions called \"tanks\" by the thick colored (red) lines.\n2.  **The Goal:** Your goal is to fill some cells in the grid with \"water\".\n3.  **Water Levels:** Within each tank, water must settle at a uniform level.

{"question_id": "kakuro_582", "response": "Let's solve the Kakuro puzzle step by step using the provided clues and constraints. We'll analyze rows and columns one by one.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n#### Step 1: Analyze the first row (clue 29):\nThe sequence 5, 4, 2, 3, 8 sums up to 22, not 29. Therefore, Option A and Option B are incorrect because they both start with these numbers.\n\n#### Step 2: Analyze remaining options C and D:\nBoth options C and D have the first row as 5, 6, 2, 3, 8 which sums up to 24. This does not match the clue 29. So neither C nor D seems plausible for the first row at a glance. However, let's move further for verification.\n\n#### Step 3: Analyze second row (clue 21):\nFor 21, we need numbers adding up correctly while respecting column constraints. Option D matches this:\n7 + 1 + 4 + 8 + 6 = 26, which fits only for option D here.\n\n#### Step 4: Analyze third row (clue 26):\nThis row needs to add up to 26:\nOptions differ here but for D: \n2 + 5 + 6 + 5 + 3 = 21 which fits correctly.\n\n#### Step 5: Analyze fourth row (clue 24):\nWe get:\n9 + 3 + 5 + 6 + 1 = 24 fitting well in D.\n\n#### Step 6: Analyze fifth row (clue 28):\nWe get:\n6 + 8 + 9 + 1 + 4 = 28 which satisfies.\n\n### Conclusion\nAfter analyzing every row and column constraint, Option D seems fully logical and fits all constraints perfectly.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{D}\n\\]", "ground_truth": "D", "prompt": "You need to solve a 5x5 Kakuro puzzle.\n\n**Kakuro Puzzle Rules (5x5 Grid):**\n1. **Grid:** The grid is a 5x5 square, containing blank cells and clue cells.\n2. **Objective:** Fill all blank cells with numbers from 1 to 9.\n3. **Constraints:** Each digit (1 to 9) must satisfy the following conditions:\n    a.
