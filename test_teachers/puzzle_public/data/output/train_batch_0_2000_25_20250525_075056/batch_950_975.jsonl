Let's break it down step by step.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n\n#### 1. Understand the Tanks\nFirst, identify the tanks formed by the red lines:\n- There are five separate tanks in the grid.\n\n#### 2. Analyze Row and Column Clues\n- **Row 0**: Needs 0 filled cells.\n- **Row 1**: Needs 0 filled cells.\n- **Row 2**: Needs 1 filled cell.\n- **Row 3**: Needs 3 filled cells.\n\n- **Column 0**: Needs 1 filled cell.\n- **Column 1**: Needs 2 filled cells.\n- **Column 2**: Needs 1 filled cell.\n- **Column 3**: Needs 0 filled cells.\n\n#### 3. Fill the Grid Based on Constraints\n- **Column 3**: Since no cells should be filled, all cells in Column 3 stay empty.\n \n- **Row 0 and Row 1**: Since both rows require 0 filled cells, they stay completely empty.\n\nNow our grid looks like:\n\n```\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n? ? ? 0\n? ? ? 0\n```\n\n- **Column 0**: Needs exactly 1 filled cell. It can only be in Row 2 since Row 0 and Row 1 are empty.\n\nSo now:\n\n```\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n1 ? ? 0\n? ? ? 0\n```\n\n- **Row 2**: Needs exactly 1 filled cell. We already have one in Column 0, so other cells in Row 2 must remain empty.\n\n```\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n1 0 0 0\n? ? ? 0\n```\n\n- **Row 3**: Needs 3 filled cells. By constraint, columns 0, 1, and 2 must be filled, and column 3 should remain empty.\n\n```\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n1 0 0 0\n1 1 1 0\n```\n\n- **Column 1**: Needs exactly 2 filled cells. We have 1 in Row 3 and another needs to be filled in Row 2.\n\nBut there’s a contradiction here because Row 2 already has 1 filled cell in Column 0, and it can't hold more filled cells by tank rule.\n\nRe-evaluate:\n- **Column 2**: Needs exactly 1 filled cell. It cannot be in Row 2. It can be only in Row 3.\n\nFinal grid configuration:\n\n```\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 1 0 0\n1 1 1 0\n```\n\n#### 4.
