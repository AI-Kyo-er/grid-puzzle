Again, all options are consistent.\n\n4. **Third row:**\n   - Row clue is 1, meaning only one cell should have water.\n   - The tank in this row spans the second and third columns. For a uniform water level, the water can only be in the second column (since placing it in the third column would require more than one cell due to the size of the tank). Option D matches this criteria.\n\n5. **Fourth row:**\n   - Row clue is 2, meaning two cells should have water.\n   - The tank in this row spans the first and second columns. The water should fill the first two cells in these columns. Options C and D match this criteria.\n\n6. **Fifth row:**\n   - Row clue is 6, meaning all six cells should have water.\n   - All options match this criteria.\n\n7. **Sixth row:**\n   - Row clue is 6, meaning all six cells should have water.\n   - All options match this criteria.\n\n8. **Verify column clues:**\n   - Column 1: Needs 3 cells of water. Option D fills the fourth, fifth, and sixth rows.\n   - Column 2: Needs 4 cells of water. Option D fills the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth rows.\n   - Columns 3-6: Need 2 cells each.

{"question_id": "aquarium_414", "response": "To solve this Aquarium Puzzle, let's break down the rules and clues given:\n\n### Tanks and Water Level Rule:\n- The tanks are separated by the red lines.
