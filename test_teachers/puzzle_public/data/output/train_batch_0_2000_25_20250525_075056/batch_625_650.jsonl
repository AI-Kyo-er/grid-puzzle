To avoid three consecutive zeros or ones, the possibilities for the blanks should be balanced and follow the rules. This leads us to `0 1 0 1`.\n\n   Now the grid looks like:\n    ```\n    _ _ _ _\n    0 1 0 1\n    1 _ _ _\n    _ 0 0 _\n    ```\n\n3. **Third Row:**\n   - The third row starts with 1. Using rule 2 again and noting that the first two rows already have their patterns set, we try filling `1 0 1 0` for balance and to avoid repeating sequences in columns.\n\n   Now the grid looks like:\n    ```\n    _ _ _ _\n    0 1 0 1\n    1 0 1 0\n    _ 0 0 _\n    ```\n\n4. **Fourth Row:**\n   - The fourth row already has `0 0`. We need to balance this and ensure it follows the other rules. Therefore, the only suitable sequence following all rules would be `1 0 0 1`.\n\n    The grid now looks like:\n    ```\n    _ _ _ _\n    0 1 0 1\n    1 0 1 0\n    1 0 0 1\n    ```\n\n5. **First Row:**\n   - Balance the entire grid and fill in the first row to avoid repeating any row/column and maintain the specified alternating pattern. The only valid option fitting all criteria here is `0 1 1 0`.\n\n   Final grid:\n    ```\n    0 1 1 0\n    0 1 0 1\n    1 0 1 0\n    1 0 0 1\n    ```\n\n6. **Check Options:**\n\nWe compare the final grid to the provided options:\n\n- Option A matches exactly with our final solution.\n\nSo, the correct option is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{A}\n\\]", "ground_truth": "A", "prompt": "You need to solve a Binairo puzzle.\n\n**Binairo Puzzle Rules:**\n1.

Further verification confirms it matches; therefore, it is the same solution.\n\n#### Option C:\n```\n5 8 1 6 7 2 9 4 3\n9 2 6 3 1 4 8 5 7\n3 4 7 9 8 5 1 6 2\n1 9 2 4 3 8 6 7 5\n6 7 9 5 2 8 4 3 1\n4 5 3 7 6 1 2 9 8\n2 6 9 8 5 3 7 1 4\n8 3 4 1 9 7 5 2 6\n7 1 5 2 4 6 3 8 9\n```\nNotice the difference: `6 7 9 5 2 8 4 3 1` does not match the original puzzle hint in that position. Thus, this cannot be the right solution.\n\n#### Option D:\n```\n5 8 1 6 7 2 9 4 3\n9 2 6 3 1 4 8 5 7\n3 4 7 9 3 5 1 6 2\n1 9 2 4 3 8 6 7 5\n6 7 8 5 2 9 4 3 1\n4 5 3 7 6 1 2 9 8\n2 6 9 8 5 3 7 1 4\n8 3 4 1 9 7 5 2 6\n7 1 5 2 4 6 3 8 9\n```\nNotice the difference: `3 4 7 9 3 5 1 6 2` has two '3's in the same row, violating the Sudoku rule. Thus, this cannot be the right solution.\n\n### Conclusion\nOnly Option A and Option B match the original puzzle and Sudoku rules.

The options should show the second column entirely filled.\n\n**Row 1 and Row 2:**\nBoth rows have a clue of '1'. Since column 2 is already filled, these filled cells must be in column 2 only for both rows.\n\nSo far, we have:\n```\n0 1 0 0 0\n0 1 0 0 0\n? ? ? 0 0\n? ? ? 0 0\n? ? ? 0 0\n```\n\n**Row 3, Row 4, and Row 5:**\nEach has a clue of '3'. Given the tanks' structure, we can deduce how water will fill based on column constraints:\n- **Column 1** must have 3 filled cells, which means there should be 3 consecutive filled cells starting from row 3 (to satisfy row constraints too).\n- **Column 3** must have 3 filled cells, which can be filled in rows 3, 4, and 5.\n\nNow, let’s check our candidate options:\n\n**Option A:**\n```\n0 1 0 0 0\n0 1 0 0 0\n1 1 1 0 0\n0 1 1 0 0\n1 1 1 0 0\n```\n- Row 4 does not meet the 3 filled requirement.\n- Thus, Option A is incorrect.\n\n**Option B:**\n```\n0 1 0 0 0\n0 1 0 0 0\n1 1 1 0 0\n1 1 1 0 0\n1 1 1 0 0\n```\n- All requirements met: Column and Row constraints comply.\nThus, Option B fits perfectly.\n\n**Option C:**\n```\n0 1 0 0 0\n0 1 0 0 0\n1 0 1 0 0\n1 1 1 0 0\n1 1 1 0 0\n```\n- Column 1 does not meet its constraint of 3 continuous cells.\nThus, Option C is incorrect.\n\n**Option D:**\n```\n0 1 0 0 1\n0 1 0 0 0\n1 1 1 0 0\n1 1 1 0 0\n1 0 1 0 0\n```\n- Column 5 has a non-zero value, contradicting its constraint (should be 0).\nThus, Option D is incorrect.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe correct option is \\boxed{B}.", "ground_truth": "B", "prompt": "You need to solve an Aquarium puzzle.\n\n**Aquarium Puzzle Rules:**\n1.  **The Grid:** The grid is divided into several regions called \"tanks\" by the thick colored (red) lines.\n2.  **The Goal:** Your goal is to fill some cells in the grid with \"water\".\n3.  **Water Levels:** Within each tank, water must settle at a uniform level.
