{"question_id": "aquarium_443", "response": "To solve this aquarium puzzle, let's analyze the clues and apply the rules step by step. \n\n### Clues Analysis\n\n- **Rows:**\n    - Row 0: 0 water cells.\n    - Row 2: 2 water cells.\n    - Row 5: 5 water cells.\n\n- **Columns:**\n    - Column 4: 4 water cells.\n    - Column 5: 4 water cells.\n    - Column 6: 3 water cells.\n    - Column 7: 3 water cells.\n    - Column 8: 3 water cells.\n\n### Step-by-step Solution\n\n#### Row 0:\nThe clue is 0, so no cells in Row 0 should have water. All cells in this row should remain empty.\n\n#### Row 2:\nThe clue is 2, and we can see there are two tanks in this row. The only way to satisfy this clue is to have both tanks filled up to level 2. This means the first two cells in both tanks should be filled with water.\n\n#### Row 5:\nThe clue is 5, meaning all cells in this row must be filled with water since there are 5 cells in this row.\n\n#### Columns:\n- Columns 4 and 5 each require 4 water cells.\n- Columns 6, 7, and 8 each require 3 water cells.\n\nBased on these constraints:\n- Columns 4 and 5 will have the last unfilled cell in the topmost rows where they can still meet the requirement of 4 water cells.\n- Columns 6, 7, and 8 will similarly adjust their water levels to ensure 3 water cells per column.\n\n### Cross-checking Options\n\nNow we'll verify each provided option against our analysis:\n\n#### Option A:\n```\n0 0 0 0 0\n1 1 0 0 0\n1 1 0 0 1\n1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1\n```\n- Row 0: Correct (0 water cells).\n- Row 2: Incorrect, does not satisfy 2 water cells in the second row.\n- Row 5: Correct (5 water cells).\n\n#### Option B:\n```\n0 0 1 0 0\n1 1 0 0 0\n0 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1\n```\n- Row 0: Incorrect (Column 3 has water in Row 0).\n\n#### Option C:\n```\n0 0 0 0 0\n1 1 0 0 0\n1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1\n```\n- Row 0: Correct (0 water cells).\n- Row 2: Incorrect, does not satisfy 2 water cells in the second row.\n- Row 5: Correct (5 water cells).\n\n#### Option D:\n```\n0 0 0 0 0\n1 1 0 0 0\n1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 0 1 1\n0 1 1 1 1\n```\n- Row 0: Correct (0 water cells).\n- Row 2: Correct (2 water cells).\n- Row 5: Incorrect, does not have 5 water cells in the 5th row.\n\n### Conclusion:\nOnly **Option C** satisfies all the constraints correctly.

Since this tank has only 3 cells, the fourth filled cell must come from another tank below.\n- Row 1 has 1 filled cell; therefore, (1,1) must be water.\n- Row 2 has 2 filled cells, so either (2,1) or (2,2) could be water. However, since (1,1) is already filled and water must settle uniformly, (2,1) must be water.\n- Row 3 does not have a number constraint but must follow the uniform water level rule. Thus, (3,1) must also be water.\n\nSo far, we have:\n```\n1 0 0 0\n1 0 0 0\n1 0 0 0\n```\n\n#### Tank 2 (Top-middle-right):\n- This tank spans (1,2), (2,2), (1,3), (1,4).\n- Column 2 needs 3 filled cells. Since (2,2) cannot be water unless (1,2) is also water due to the uniform level rule, (1,2) must be water.\n- Now Column 2 still needs 2 more filled cells. As (2,2) must be filled, (3,2) and (4,2) must also be filled.\n\nSo far, we have:\n```\n1 1 0 0\n1 1 0 0\n1 1 0 0\n```\n\n#### Tank 3 (Bottom):\n- This tank spans (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4).\n- Row 4 needs 4 filled cells.
