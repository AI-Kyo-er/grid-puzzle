For example, the first row has two '8's which violates the Sudoku rule that each number should appear only once per row. Thus, Option B can be discarded.\n\n### Verification of Option C:\nSimilarly, Option C shows repeating numbers in the 5th column where '2' appears twice. Therefore, Option C fails the Sudoku rules and can be discarded.\n\n### Verification of Option D:\nOn reviewing, Option D is identical to Option A.
