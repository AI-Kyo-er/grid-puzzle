{"question_id": "aquarium_641", "response": "To solve this Aquarium puzzle, let's go through the steps one by one:\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Tanks\n\nThe tanks are defined by the red lines. There are four tanks in this puzzle:\n\n1. Top-left tank: 2x2 grid (top-left corner).\n2. Top-right tank: 2x2 grid (top-right corner).\n3. Bottom-left tank: 2x2 grid (bottom-left corner).\n4. Bottom-right tank: 2x2 grid (bottom-right corner).\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Clues\n\n- Row clues (from left):\n  - Row 1: 2 (two cells filled)\n  - Row 2: 2 (two cells filled)\n  - Row 3: 3 (three cells filled)\n  - Row 4: 4 (four cells filled)\n\n- Column clues (from top):\n  - Column 1: 1 (one cell filled)\n  - Column 2: 2 (two cells filled)\n  - Column 3: 4 (four cells filled)\n  - Column 4: 4 (four cells filled)\n\n### Step 3: Apply Logical Reasoning\n\n#### Tank 1 (Top-left, 2x2):\n\n- Row 1 has two filled cells.\n- Column 1 has only one filled cell.\n- Therefore, the top-left cell cannot be filled since it would violate Column 1's clue.\n- Thus, the filled cells in Row 1 must be the top-right and bottom-left cells.\n\n#### Tank 2 (Top-right, 2x2):\n\n- Row 1 already has one filled cell from Tank 1.\n- To satisfy Row 1's clue, another cell in Tank 2 must be filled.\n- Column 3 has four filled cells, so both cells in the second column of Tank 2 must be filled.\n\n#### Tank 3 (Bottom-left, 2x2):\n\n- Row 3 has three filled cells.\n- Column 1 has only one filled cell, so the bottom-left cell must be filled.\n- To satisfy Row 3's clue, the other two cells in this row must also be filled.\n\n#### Tank 4 (Bottom-right, 2x2):\n\n- Row 4 has four filled cells, so all cells in this row must be filled.\n\n### Step 4: Verify the Solution\n\nUsing the above logic, the solution should look like:\n\n```\n0 1 1 1\n0 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1\n```\n\n### Step 5: Match with Options\n\nThis matches Option B:\n\n```\n0 1 1 1\n0 0 1 1\n0 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1\n```\n\nSo the correct answer is:\n\n\\boxed{B}", "ground_truth": "D", "prompt": "You need to solve an Aquarium puzzle.\n\n**Aquarium Puzzle Rules:**\n1.  **The Grid:** The grid is divided into several regions called \"tanks\" by the thick colored (red) lines.\n2.  **The Goal:** Your goal is to fill some cells in the grid with \"water\".\n3.  **Water Levels:** Within each tank, water must settle at a uniform level.

Therefore, option A is incorrect.\n\nMoving to Option B:\n```plaintext\n6 2 1 4 3 5 8 9 7\n4 9 7 1 6 8 5 2 3\n5 3 8 7 2 9 4 6 1\n8 6 4 9 7 2 3 1 5\n9 5 2 3 8 1 6 7 4\n7 1 3 6 5 4 9 8 2\n1 7 5 8 4 6 2 3 9\n3 4 6 2 9 7 1 5 8\n2 8 9 5 1 3 7 4 6\n```\n\n- The second row has two 9s, which violates the rule that each number can only appear once per row. Thus, Option B is incorrect.\n\nConsidering Option C:\n```plaintext\n6 2 3 4 3 5 8 9 7\n4 9 7 2 6 8 5 2 3\n5 3 8 7 2 9 4 6 1\n8 6 4 9 7 2 3 1 5\n9 5 2 3 8 1 6 7 4\n7 1 3 6 5 4 9 8 2\n1 7 5 8 4 6 2 3 9\n3 4 6 2 9 7 1 5 8\n2 8 9 5 1 3 7 4 6\n```\n\n- The first row has two 3s, which violates the rule that each number can only appear once per row.
