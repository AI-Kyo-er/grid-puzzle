Within each tank, water must fill uniformly from the bottom up. \n\nThere are two tanks:\n1. A large tank covering the entire left 6 cells (3x2).\n2. A small tank consisting of the bottom-right 2x2 cells.\n\n#### Step 2: Analyze Row and Column Clues\n\n- **Top Row (0):** No cells should be filled with water.\n- **Second Row (0):** No cells should be filled with water.\n- **Third Row (2):** Two cells must be filled with water.\n- **Bottom Row (2):** Two cells must be filled with water.\n\n- **Left Column (0):** No cells should be filled with water.\n- **Second Column (0):** No cells should be filled with water.\n- **Third Column (2):** Two cells must be filled with water.\n- **Right Column (2):** Two cells must be filled with water.\n\n#### Step 3: Fill the Tanks According to Constraints\n\n1. **Top-left tank (6 cells):**\n   - Top two rows (rows 1 and 2) must remain empty based on their clues.\n   - Third and bottom rows must have water filling uniformly due to the water-level rule.\n\n2. **Bottom-right tank (4 cells):**\n   - It needs 2 cells filled per column clue.\n   - Since it’s a 2x2 square, both bottom cells must be filled to satisfy the water-level rule.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the above analysis, the correct grid configuration is:\n\n- Top two rows completely empty.\n- Bottom-left two cells in the third row empty (to not exceed column 0 clues).\n- Bottom-right 2x2 tank filled completely.\n\nThus, Option B matches this configuration perfectly:\n\n```plaintext\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 1\n0 0 1 1\n```\n\nTherefore, the answer is \\(\\boxed{B}\\).", "ground_truth": "B", "prompt": "You need to solve an Aquarium puzzle.\n\n**Aquarium Puzzle Rules:**\n1.  **The Grid:** The grid is divided into several regions called \"tanks\" by the thick colored (red) lines.\n2.  **The Goal:** Your goal is to fill some cells in the grid with \"water\".\n3.  **Water Levels:** Within each tank, water must settle at a uniform level. This means: if a cell is filled with water, all cells directly below it *within the same tank* must also be filled, down to the bottom of that tank.\n4.  **Clues:** The numbers outside the grid indicate how many cells *in total* must be filled with water in that specific row (numbers on the left) or column (numbers on the top).\n5.  **Solving:** Use the numbers as clues to figure out which cells must be filled with water, ensuring that the water level rule within each tank is followed, until all numbers are satisfied.\n\n\nYour task is to choose the correct grid configuration from the options below that represents the solution to the puzzle.

Only one cell should be filled (the bottom one). \n- **Column 4 (clue 0)**:\n  - No cells should be filled.\n\n### Comparing Options:\n- **Option A**: Incorrect because it has only one filled cell in row 3 instead of two.\n- **Option B**: Incorrect because it has an extra filled cell in row 4, column 3.\n- **Option C**: Matches our analysis perfectly. It has two filled cells in row 3 and three filled cells in row 4, satisfying all column and row clues.\n- **Option D**: Incorrect because it violates the water-level rule in multiple places and doesn't match the required number of filled cells in the rows and columns.\n\nTherefore, the correct grid configuration is:\n\n\\boxed{C}", "ground_truth": "B", "prompt": "You need to solve an Aquarium puzzle.\n\n**Aquarium Puzzle Rules:**\n1.  **The Grid:** The grid is divided into several regions called \"tanks\" by the thick colored (red) lines.\n2.  **The Goal:** Your goal is to fill some cells in the grid with \"water\".\n3.  **Water Levels:** Within each tank, water must settle at a uniform level.
