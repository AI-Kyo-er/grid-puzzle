{"question_id": "aquarium_642", "response": "Let's break down the puzzle and solve it step-by-step using the given rules and clues.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n\n#### Step 1: Identify Tanks and Clues\nThe tanks are divided by red lines. We have two tanks:\n1. A small tank consisting of three cells in the third row (columns 2, 3).\n2. A large tank covering the remaining cells.\n\nThe clues provided are:\n- Row clues: [0, 0, 1, 5, 5]\n- Column clues: [2, 2, 3, 2, 2]\n\n#### Step 2: Analyze the Small Tank (Third Row)\n\nThe clue for this row is `1`, which means only one cell should be filled with water. The water must settle at a uniform level within the tank, so both cells in the tank will either be filled or empty together.\n\nThus, we cannot satisfy the row clue with these two cells alone. Consequently, the only possible cell to have water is outside this small tank but still in the same row. Hence, there can't be any water in this small tank. \n\n#### Step 3: Analyze the Large Tank\n\nGiven the row clues `5` for rows 4 and 5, these rows must be completely filled with water. We now know:\n```\nRow 4: 1 1 1 1 1\nRow 5: 1 1 1 1 1\n```\n\n#### Step 4: Check Column Constraints\n\nWith the last two rows filled with water, we automatically fulfill part of the column requirements:\n- Columns 1, 2, 4, 5 already have 2 filled cells (from rows 4 and 5), fulfilling their requirements `[2, 2, 2, 2]`.\n- Column 3 needs 3 filled cells. It currently has 2 filled cells, so it needs one more.\n\n#### Step 5: Complete the Puzzle\n\nThe only place left to add one more water cell in column 3 (to make it 3) is row 3 since other rows are either not allowed or already have 0 requirement. Thus:\n```\nRow 3: 0 0 1 0 0\n```\n\nPutting it all together, our final grid configuration is:\n```\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0\n1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1\n```\n\nThis matches Option B.\n\n### Conclusion\nTherefore, the correct grid configuration is \\boxed{B}.", "ground_truth": "B", "prompt": "You need to solve an Aquarium puzzle.\n\n**Aquarium Puzzle Rules:**\n1.  **The Grid:** The grid is divided into several regions called \"tanks\" by the thick colored (red) lines.\n2.  **The Goal:** Your goal is to fill some cells in the grid with \"water\".\n3.  **Water Levels:** Within each tank, water must settle at a uniform level.
