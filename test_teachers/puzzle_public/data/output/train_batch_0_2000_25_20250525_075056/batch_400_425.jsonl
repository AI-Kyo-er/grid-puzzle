Thus, the two filled cells must be in the rightmost tank.\n\nThus, the fourth row becomes `0 0 0 1`.\n\n### Step 5: Verify the column clues\n- Column 1: Has `3` filled cells (`1`, `1`, `1`), so `3` is correct.\n- Column 2: Has `0` filled cells (`0`, `1`, `1`), so `0` is correct.\n- Column 3: Has `0` filled cells (`0`, `0`, `0`), so `0` is correct.\n- Column 4: Has `4` filled cells (`0`, `0`, `0`, `1`), so `4` is correct.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter solving, the grid looks like:\n```\n1 0 0 0\n1 1 0 0\n1 1 0 0\n0 0 0 1\n```\n\nThis matches Option C.

There are two vertical tanks and one horizontal tank in the middle. We'll analyze each tank separately while keeping in mind the water settling rule.\n\n### Step 2: Row and Column Clues\n- Row clues (left side):\n  - Row 0: 0\n  - Row 1: 0\n  - Row 2: 2\n  - Row 3: 2\n  - Row 4: 5\n  - Row 5: 5\n\n- Column clues (top side):\n  - Column 0: 0\n  - Column 1: 2\n  - Column 2: 2\n  - Column 3: 2\n  - Column 4: 4\n  - Column 5: 4\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing the Tanks\n#### Left Vertical Tank\n- Covers columns 0, 1, 2, and rows 4, 5.\n- Row 4 and 5 both have 5 filled cells, meaning all cells in this tank should be filled.\n- Column 0 has 0 filled cells, so all cells in column 0 remain empty.\n- Columns 1, 2 should have 2 filled cells each.\n\nSo, the left vertical tank will look like:\n```\n0 1 1\n0 1 1\n```\n\n#### Right Vertical Tank\n- Covers columns 3, 4, and rows 2, 3, 4, 5.\n- Rows 2 and 3 have 2 filled cells each, and the water settles uniformly.\n- Columns 4 and 5 should have 4 filled cells each.\n\nSo, the right vertical tank will look like:\n```\n0 1 1\n0 1 1\n1 1 1\n1 1 1\n```\n\n#### Horizontal Tank\n- Covers columns 3, 4 and rows 2, 3.\n- Rows 2, 3 have 2 filled cells each.\n\nSo, the horizontal tank fits with:\n```\n0 1 1\n0 1 1\n```\n\n### Step 4: Verifying the Options\nNow let’s check which option fits our analysis:\n- Option A does not fit as it doesn't satisfy the row and column constraints.\n- Option B doesn't fit as it violates the uniform water level in the right vertical tank.\n- Option C fits well with the deductions made above.\n- Option D doesn’t fit due to the non-uniform water levels.\n\n### Final Answer\nThus, the correct option is \\boxed{C}.", "ground_truth": "A", "prompt": "You need to solve an Aquarium puzzle.\n\n**Aquarium Puzzle Rules:**\n1.  **The Grid:** The grid is divided into several regions called \"tanks\" by the thick colored (red) lines.\n2.  **The Goal:** Your goal is to fill some cells in the grid with \"water\".\n3.  **Water Levels:** Within each tank, water must settle at a uniform level.
