Their positions help in determining the water levels uniformly inside each tank.\n\n2. **Row Numbers:**\n   - Row 1: `1` - Only one cell must be filled.\n   - Row 2: `2` - Two cells must be filled.\n   - Row 3: `4` - All four cells must be filled.\n   - Row 4: `4` - All four cells must be filled.\n\n3. **Column Numbers:**\n   - Column 1: `3` - Three cells must be filled.\n   - Column 2: `2` - Two cells must be filled.\n   - Column 3: `2` - Two cells must be filled.\n   - Column 4: `4` - All four cells must be filled.\n\n### Step 2: Fill the Grid According to Constraints\n\n#### Row 3 and Row 4\n- Both rows require all four cells to be filled:\n  ```\n  1 1 1 1\n  1 1 1 1\n  ```\n\n#### Column 4\n- All cells in this column must be filled.

Since Row 3 and Row 4 are already filled, only one more cell needs to be filled in Row 1 or Row 2:\n  - Row 1 can only have one cell filled, so it must be the top-left cell.\n  - Therefore, Row 2 will have its first cell filled to satisfy the three-cell condition for Column 1.\n\n#### Column 2 and Column 3\n- Column 2 needs two cells and Column 3 needs two cells. With Row 3 and Row 4 already filled, we need to place these cells in Row 1 and Row 2.\n\n    For Column 2:\n    - Row 1 cannot be filled because it already has one cell in Column 1.\n    - Row 2 will have a filled cell here.\n    \n    For Column 3:\n    - Row 1 can have a filled cell.\n    - Row 2 will automatically get its second filled cell.\n  \n### Step 3: Final Grid Configuration\n\nBased on the above analysis, the grid should look like this:\n```\n0 0 0 1\n1 0 0 1\n1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1\n```\n\nThis matches Option A.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{A}\n\\]", "ground_truth": "A", "prompt": "You need to solve an Aquarium puzzle.\n\n**Aquarium Puzzle Rules:**\n1.  **The Grid:** The grid is divided into several regions called \"tanks\" by the thick colored (red) lines.\n2.  **The Goal:** Your goal is to fill some cells in the grid with \"water\".\n3.  **Water Levels:** Within each tank, water must settle at a uniform level.
