Thus, only the top cell of either column can be filled, but not both.\n- By examining other clues, the first cell of the first column should be filled.\n\n#### Tank 2 (Middle two columns):\n- Row 1 and 2 both have a clue of `1`, similar to the previous tank. Only one cell per row should be filled.\n- Looking at the rest of the constraints, we see that only the bottom cell of the second row in the third column should be filled for consistency.\n\n#### Tank 3 (Rightmost column):\n- Column 5 has a clue of `3`, meaning three out of five cells should be filled.\n- The only way to satisfy this while keeping the water level uniform is filling the bottom three cells.\n\n### Step 3: Fill the Grid Based on Observations\n\nUsing the analysis above, let's fill the grid step-by-step.\n\n```\n1 0 | 0 0 | 0\n1 0 | 0 0 | 0\n1 1 | 1 0 | 1\n1 1 | 1 1 | 1\n1 1 | 1 1 | 1\n-----------\n1   2   3\n```\n\nThis matches Option C:\n```\n1 0 0 0 0\n1 0 0 0 0\n1 1 1 0 1\n1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1\n```\n\nTherefore, the correct option is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{C}\n\\]", "ground_truth": "C", "prompt": "You need to solve an Aquarium puzzle.\n\n**Aquarium Puzzle Rules:**\n1.  **The Grid:** The grid is divided into several regions called \"tanks\" by the thick colored (red) lines.\n2.  **The Goal:** Your goal is to fill some cells in the grid with \"water\".\n3.  **Water Levels:** Within each tank, water must settle at a uniform level.

Thus, all cells in this row must be empty.\n\n2. **Second Row (Row 2):** Clue `2` \n   - Two cells must contain water in this row. \n   - The leftmost tank has only two cells in this row. Therefore, both these cells must be filled with water to achieve the count of 2.\n\n3. **Third Row (Row 3):** Clue `2` \n   - Two cells must contain water in this row.\n   - In the leftmost tank, there are already two cells filled based on the previous row. These should remain filled as water levels are uniform in the same tank.\n   - For the right tank, since the clue is `2`, we check if any other cell fits but find that the previous row already fills up the quota.\n\n4. **Fourth Row (Row 4):** Clue `2` \n   - Two cells must contain water in this row.\n   - The leftmost tank extends here, so it's filled up uniformly as per the above rows.\n   - The right tank requires filling one more cell; hence, the first cell in the right tank gets filled.\n\n5. **Fifth Row (Row 5):** Clue `4` \n   - Four cells must contain water in this row, filling all cells in the left tank and the adjacent right tank's first two cells.\n\n6. **Columns Check:**\n   - Column 1: `2` (satisfied by rows 2-3)\n   - Column 2: `2` (satisfied by rows 2-3).\n   - Column 3: `2` (satisfied by rows 2-3).\n   - Column 4: `5` (all cells filled).\n   - Column 5: `5` (all cells filled).\n\nNow, cross-checking the configurations:\n\n- **Option A**:\n    ```\n    0 0 0 1 1\n    0 0 0 1 1\n    0 0 0 1 1\n    0 1 1 1 1\n    0 1 1 1 0\n    ```\n    This does not satisfy the last column clue `5`.\n\n- **Option B**:\n    ```\n    0 0 0 1 1\n    0 0 1 0 1\n    0 0 0 1 1\n    0 1 1 1 1\n    0 1 1 1 1\n    ```\n    This does not follow the uniform water level rule as the second row disrupts it.\n\n- **Option C**:\n    ```\n    0 0 0 1 1\n    0 0 0 1 1\n    0 0 0 1 1\n    0 1 1 1 1\n    0 1 1 1 1\n    ```\n    This matches our deductions correctly.\n\n- **Option D**:\n    ```\n    0 0 0 1 1\n    0 0 0 1 1\n    0 0 0 1 1\n    0 1 1 0 1\n    0 1 0 1 1\n    ```\n    This violates the uniform water level rule in several places.\n\nThus, after analysis, the correct option is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{C}\n\\]", "ground_truth": "C", "prompt": "You need to solve an Aquarium puzzle.\n\n**Aquarium Puzzle Rules:**\n1.  **The Grid:** The grid is divided into several regions called \"tanks\" by the thick colored (red) lines.\n2.  **The Goal:** Your goal is to fill some cells in the grid with \"water\".\n3.  **Water Levels:** Within each tank, water must settle at a uniform level.
