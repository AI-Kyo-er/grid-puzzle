{"question_id": "aquarium_183", "response": "To determine the correct solution among the provided options, let's carefully analyze the given constraints and apply the rules systematically.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n#### 1. Column Constraints:\n- **Column 1**: Clue is '5'. Since there are only 5 cells in this column, all cells must be filled with water.\n- **Column 2**: Clue is '2'. There are two tanks to consider:\n    - The first tank (top 2 rows): Can hold at most 2 cells. To meet the clue, both cells must be filled.\n    - The second tank (bottom 3 rows): Must also have a uniform level but the first tank already meets the clue for this column, so these cells remain empty.\n- **Column 3**: Clue is '3'. There’s only one tank in this column spanning all 5 rows. Thus, the bottom three cells must be filled with water.\n- **Column 4**: Clue is '3'. The column has two tanks:\n    - Top tank (rows 1-2): Both cells cannot be filled because we would exceed the column constraint.\n    - Bottom tank (rows 3-5): The bottom three cells must be filled to satisfy the constraint.\n- **Column 5**: Clue is '0'. This means no cells in this column should be filled with water.\n\n#### 2. Row Constraints:\n- **Row 1 & 2**: Both have a clue of '1'. Only one cell can be filled in each row. From our column analysis, we know only the first cell in both rows will satisfy this.\n- **Row 3**: Clue is '3'. We have one cell filled in column 1, one in column 3 and one in column 4, satisfying the clue.\n- **Row 4 & 5**: Both have a clue of '4'. In both rows, four cells are filled: one in column 1, two in column 3, and one in column 4.\n\n### Matching the Analysis with Options:\n\nLet's match the filled cells with the given options:\n\n- **Option A**:\n```\n1 0 0 0 0\n1 0 0 0 0\n1 0 1 1 0\n1 1 1 1 0\n1 1 1 1 0\n```\nCorrectly fills columns 1, 2, 3, 4, and follows the row clues correctly.

To avoid three consecutive numbers, the second position cannot be `0` because it would become `1 0 0`. So it must be `1`. The fourth position in the first row must be `0` for balance.\n    - The updated first row is `1 1 0 0`.\n\n2. **Each row and each column must contain an equal number of 0s and 1s**:\n    - In the second row, it currently has `_ _ 1 _`. We need two `0`s and one more `1`.\n    - The third row needs to be balanced as well. Currently, `_ 0 1 _` could place `1` in the first position and `0` in the last to satisfy other rules.\n    - For the fourth row, the current `1 1 _ _` needs two `0`s.
