{"question_id": "aquarium_449", "response": "To find the correct configuration for this Aquarium Puzzle, we should analyze both the row and column clues while adhering to the water level rules.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n#### Row Clues:\n- The first four rows (from the top) have a clue of 3. This means three cells must be filled in these rows.\n- The last two rows have a clue of 4. This means four cells must be filled in these rows.\n\n#### Column Clues:\n- The first three columns have a clue of 6. This means all six cells must be filled in these columns.\n- The fourth column has a clue of 0. This means no cells must be filled in this column.\n- The fifth column has a clue of 2. This means two cells must be filled in this column.\n- The sixth column has a clue of 0. This means no cells must be filled in this column.\n\n### Filling Based on Clues:\n\n1. **First Three Columns**: All cells must be filled due to the clue '6'.\n   - These cells will be filled regardless of the row clues.\n   \n2. **Fourth Column**: No cells can be filled due to the clue '0'.\n   - These cells remain empty.\n   \n3. **Fifth Column**: Two cells must be filled due to the clue '2'. Since the water level must be uniform within tanks:\n   - The bottom two cells will be filled because they fall within the tank that spans these two cells.\n   \n4. **Sixth Column**: No cells can be filled due to the clue '0'.\n   - These cells remain empty.\n\n### Verifying with Row Clues:\n\n1. **First Four Rows**: Each of these rows needs exactly three filled cells.\n   - Given the filling pattern above, the first three columns already contribute three filled cells per row.\n   \n2. **Last Two Rows**: Each of these rows needs exactly four filled cells.\n   - Given the filling pattern above, the first three columns contribute three filled cells, and the additional one comes from the fifth column.\n\n### Final Solution Configuration:\n\nBased on our analysis, the correct configuration matches Option B:\n\n```\n1 1 1 0 0 0\n1 1 1 0 0 0\n1 1 1 0 0 0\n1 1 1 0 0 0\n1 1 1 0 1 0\n1 1 1 0 1 0\n```\n\nThus, the final answer is \\boxed{B}.", "ground_truth": "B", "prompt": "You need to solve an Aquarium puzzle.\n\n**Aquarium Puzzle Rules:**\n1.  **The Grid:** The grid is divided into several regions called \"tanks\" by the thick colored (red) lines.\n2.  **The Goal:** Your goal is to fill some cells in the grid with \"water\".\n3.  **Water Levels:** Within each tank, water must settle at a uniform level.

These tell us the number of cells that must be filled with water in each row and column.\n\n#### Rows:\n- Row 1: 3\n- Row 2: 3\n- Row 3: 3\n- Row 4: 6\n- Row 5: 6\n- Row 6: 6\n\n#### Columns:\n- Column 1: 6\n- Column 2: 6\n- Column 3: 3\n- Column 4: 3\n- Column 5: 3\n- Column 6: 6\n\n### Step 2: Identify Tanks and Water Levels\n\nEach red line defines a separate \"tank,\" and water must fill uniformly from the bottom to a consistent level within each tank.\n\n### Step 3: Solve by Process of Elimination\n\n#### Start with Row 4, 5, and 6 (rows requiring 6 filled cells):\n\nThese rows span across multiple tanks but must entirely be filled since there are no breaks in these rows' requirements.

This confirms the fourth column as (1, 1, 1, 1).\n\n3. **Row 3 clue (2):**\n   - Only two cells in this row can be filled. Since Column 4 is already filled, only one more cell needs to be filled in this row. The only possible tank to fill is the first cell of the third row (1 0 0 1).\n\n4. **Row 2 and Row 1 clues (both 1):**\n   - For Row 2, since the last cell in Column 4 is filled, no other cell in Row 2 can be filled because it would exceed the count of 1.\n   - For Row 1, again because of Column 4 being filled, no other cell in Row 1 can be filled.\n\n5. **Column 1, 2, and 3 clues:**\n   - Column 1 has a clue of 2, and the only possible places to fill are the third and fourth rows (0, 0, 1, 1).\n   - Column 2 and 3 have a clue of 1 each, and they can only be filled in the third row (0, 0, 0, 0 for Col 2 and 0, 0, 0, 0 for Col 3).\n\nCombining all these deductions, the final grid should look like this:\n\n```\n0 0 0 1 \n0 0 0 1 \n1 0 0 1 \n1 1 1 1 \n```\n\nThis matches exactly with Option B.\n\nSo, the correct answer is \\boxed{B}.", "ground_truth": "B", "prompt": "You need to solve an Aquarium puzzle.\n\n**Aquarium Puzzle Rules:**\n1.  **The Grid:** The grid is divided into several regions called \"tanks\" by the thick colored (red) lines.\n2.  **The Goal:** Your goal is to fill some cells in the grid with \"water\".\n3.  **Water Levels:** Within each tank, water must settle at a uniform level.
