Since these columns span 6 rows, the topmost cell in each of these columns should be empty, and the remaining 5 cells should be filled.\n\n##### Row 1:\n- It has 1 filled cell. The only place it can go without violating other constraints is the last cell (Column 6).\n\n##### Row 2:\n- It needs 4 filled cells. Columns 2 and 1 are already determined. Therefore, columns 3, 4, 5, and 6 will be filled.\n\n##### Row 3:\n- Similar logic applies, filling Columns 3, 4, 5, and 6.\n\n##### Row 4:\n- It also needs 4 filled cells. Given the constraints, Columns 3, 4, 5, and 6 will be filled.\n\n##### Row 5 and 6:\n- Both need 5 filled cells.

{"question_id": "aquarium_363", "response": "To solve this Aquarium puzzle, we should carefully consider the constraints provided by the numbers on the sides and tops of the grid, along with the requirement that water levels must be uniform within each tank.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Analyze the Row and Column Clues:**\n\n   - **Row Clues (left side):**\n     - Row 1 has a clue of 1. This indicates that only one cell in this row needs to be filled with water.\n     - Row 2 has a clue of 3. This indicates that three cells in this row need to be filled with water.\n     - Row 3 has a clue of 4. This indicates that all four cells in this row need to be filled with water.\n     - Row 4 has a clue of 4. This indicates that all four cells in this row need to be filled with water.\n\n   - **Column Clues (top side):**\n     - Column 1 has a clue of 4. This indicates that all four cells in this column need to be filled with water.\n     - Column 2 has a clue of 3. This indicates that three cells in this column need to be filled with water.\n     - Column 3 has a clue of 3. This indicates that three cells in this column need to be filled with water.\n     - Column 4 has a clue of 2. This indicates that two cells in this column need to be filled with water.\n\n2. **Determine Water Levels in Each Tank:**\n\n   - **Tank Analysis:**\n     - **Top-left tank (2x2):**\n       - Since Row 1 must have exactly one water cell, and Column 1 must have all four water cells, the first cell in the top-left tank must be filled with water. Thus, the configuration for this tank must be:\n         ```\n         1 0 \n         1 0 \n         ```\n\n     - **Middle-right tank (2x2):**\n       - Row 2 needs three water cells. With the first column already having a water cell in Row 2, the other two cells in Row 2 must be water. Also, Column 3 needs three water cells so the last two cells in this column must be water. Hence, this tank must be:\n         ```\n         1 0 \n         1 1 \n         ```\n\n     - **Bottom-left tank (2x2):**\n       - Rows 3 and 4 both require all four water cells, and Columns 1 and 2 also require their full height filled with water. Therefore, this tank must be fully filled with water:\n         ```\n         1 1 \n         1 1 \n         ```\n\n     - **Bottom-right tank (2x2):**\n       - Row 3 requires all four water cells and Column 4 requires only two water cells, thus the bottom two cells in this column must be empty. This tank must be:\n         ```\n         1 1 \n         1 0 \n         ```\n\n3. **Combine All Tanks:**\n\n   Combining these configurations gives us the solution:\n   ```\n   1 0 0 0\n   1 1 1 0\n   1 1 1 1\n   1 1 1 0\n   ```\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe correct option matching this configuration is Option C.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{C}\n\\]", "ground_truth": "C", "prompt": "You need to solve an Aquarium puzzle.\n\n**Aquarium Puzzle Rules:**\n1.  **The Grid:** The grid is divided into several regions called \"tanks\" by the thick colored (red) lines.\n2.  **The Goal:** Your goal is to fill some cells in the grid with \"water\".\n3.  **Water Levels:** Within each tank, water must settle at a uniform level.
