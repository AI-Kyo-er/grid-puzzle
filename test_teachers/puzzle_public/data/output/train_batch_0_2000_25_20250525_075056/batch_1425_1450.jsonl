These tanks are:\n1. Top-left 2x2 square.\n2. Top-right 2x2 square.\n3. Bottom-left L-shaped tank.\n4. Bottom-right 2x2 square.\n\nThe clues for rows and columns are as follows:\n- Rows: 1, 3, 4, 4\n- Columns: 2, 3, 3, 4\n\n### Step 2: Fill Cells Based on Clues\n\n#### Tank 4 (Bottom-right 2x2 square):\n- The last column has a clue of 4, meaning all cells in the bottom-right 2x2 tank must be filled with water.\n```\n1 1\n1 1\n```\n\n#### Tank 3 (Bottom-left L-shaped tank):\n- The third row has a clue of 4, so all cells in the bottom-left tank must be filled with water.\n```\n1 1 1 0\n1 1 1 0\n```\n\n#### Tank 2 (Top-right 2x2 square):\n- The second column has a clue of 3, and since the third row already has water in its first two cells, there must be one more cell filled in the second row of this tank. Thus, both cells in the second column of this tank must be filled.\n```\n0 1 1 0\n```\n\n#### Tank 1 (Top-left 2x2 square):\n- The first row has a clue of 1, meaning only the last cell in this tank can be filled with water, since the other cells would otherwise violate the water filling rules.\n```\n0 0 0 1\n```\n\n### Step 3: Combine All Tanks to Form the Solution\n\nBy combining all filled cells from each tank, we get the following solution grid:\n```\n0 0 0 1\n0 1 1 0\n1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1\n```\n\nThis matches exactly with Option A.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{A}\n\\]", "ground_truth": "C", "prompt": "You need to solve an Aquarium puzzle.\n\n**Aquarium Puzzle Rules:**\n1.  **The Grid:** The grid is divided into several regions called \"tanks\" by the thick colored (red) lines.\n2.  **The Goal:** Your goal is to fill some cells in the grid with \"water\".\n3.  **Water Levels:** Within each tank, water must settle at a uniform level.
