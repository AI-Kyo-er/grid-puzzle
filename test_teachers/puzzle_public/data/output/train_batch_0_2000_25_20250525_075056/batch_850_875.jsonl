Analyze the Tanks and Clues\n- We have 6 rows and 6 columns.\n- The red lines divide the grid into tanks, and the numbers outside the grid give us hints about the number of water-filled cells.\n\n#### 2. Identify the Water Filling Constraints\n- For each tank, the water level must be uniform from the bottom up.\n- Check the numbers on the left side (rows) and top side (columns) individually.\n\n#### 3. Start Filling Cells Based on Row/Column Clues\n\n##### Row Analysis:\n- **Row 1-3:** Each has a clue '3'. These rows should have exactly 3 cells filled.\n\n- **Row 4:** Clue '4'. This row needs 4 filled cells.\n\n- **Row 5-6:** Both have a clue '6'. These rows need to be completely filled with water since there are 6 columns.\n\n##### Column Analysis:\n- **Column 1-2:** Each has a clue '2'.

Considering they are not fully filled yet and we haven't violated any other constraints, the top 2 cells can be selected:\n  ```\n  0 0 0 1 1 1\n  0 0 0 1 1 1\n  0 0 0 1 1 1\n  0 0 1 1 1 1\n  1 1 1 1 1 1\n  1 1 1 1 1 1\n  ```\n\nThis matches Option A.\n\n#### 5.

So, it should have two 0s. Also, it cannot have three consecutive numbers. Therefore, the possible configurations are:\n- `0 0 1 1` OR `0 1 0 1` OR `1 0 0 1`\n\nChecking for Rule 2, if we try `0 0 1 1`, it fits:\n```\n _  _  _  _\n _  _  _  1\n0  _  _  _\n0 0 1 1 \n```\n\n#### Row 3:\nIt already has one 0 and needs three more numbers with equal 0s and 1s. Also, can't have three consecutive numbers. Possible configurations:\n- `0 _ _ 1` or `_ 0 _ 1` or `_ _ 0 1`\n\nTrying `0 1 0 1`:\n```\n _  _  _  _\n _  _  _  1\n0 1 0 1\n0 0 1 1\n```\n\n#### Row 2:\nNeeds three more numbers with equal 0s and 1s.
