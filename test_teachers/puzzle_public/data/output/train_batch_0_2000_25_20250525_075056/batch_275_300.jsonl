In the first row, there are two tanks; one on the left (two cells) and one on the right (two cells). To satisfy the '2' clue, both cells of either the left tank or the right tank must be filled with water. Since filling the entire left tank would not satisfy any other constraints easily, we choose to fill the entire right tank.\n- Row 2 and Row 3 have a clue of '2' each. The only way to satisfy this is by filling the rightmost cells in these rows because the leftmost cells belong to a separate tank.\n- Row 4 has a clue of '3'. Looking at this row, it has a single tank spanning three cells on the right. To satisfy the '3' clue, these three cells must be filled with water.\n\n### Analyzing the Columns:\n- Column 1 has a clue of '0', meaning no cells in this column should be filled with water.\n- Column 2 has a clue of '1'.

{"question_id": "aquarium_323", "response": "To solve this Aquarium puzzle, we'll start by analyzing the clues provided for the rows and columns and ensuring the water levels follow the uniformity rule within each tank.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n\n#### Step 1: Analyze Row Clues\n- Row 0 has a clue \"0\": This means no cells in this row should contain water.\n- Row 1 has a clue \"2\": Two cells in total should be filled with water in this row.\n- Row 2 has a clue \"2\": Two cells in total should be filled with water in this row.\n- Row 3 has a clue \"2\": Two cells in total should be filled with water in this row.\n- Row 4 has a clue \"5\": Five cells in total should be filled with water in this row.\n- Row 5 has a clue \"6\": All six cells in this row should be filled with water.\n\n#### Step 2: Analyze Column Clues\n- Column 0 has a clue \"5\": Five cells in total should be filled with water in this column.\n- Column 1 has a clue \"5\": Five cells in total should be filled with water in this column.\n- Column 2 has a clue \"2\": Two cells in total should be filled with water in this column.\n- Column 3 has a clue \"1\": One cell in total should be filled with water in this column.\n- Column 4 has a clue \"2\": Two cells in total should be filled with water in this column.\n- Column 5 has a clue \"2\": Two cells in total should be filled with water in this column.\n\n#### Step 3: Apply the Constraints and Solve\n\n1. **Row 5**: Since every cell in this row should be filled with water, it will look like `1 1 1 1 1 1`.\n2. **Column 0 and Column 1**: Both have a clue \"5\". So the first five cells in both these columns should be filled, starting from row 1 since row 0 cannot have any water.\n   - Rows 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 in columns 0 and 1 should be filled with water.\n3. **Rows 1, 2, and 3**: These rows have 2 cells filled. Based on the above filling:\n   - The first two cells in these rows are already filled due to columns 0 and 1. These fit the row constraints perfectly.\n4. **Rows 4 and 5**: Row 4 needs 5 cells filled, and row 5 already has all cells filled.\n   - Columns 2, 3, 4, and 5 in Row 4 need to be filled.\n\n#### Step 4: Check Column Constraints\n- Column 2 needs 2 cells filled. They can be in Row 4 and 5.\n- Column 3 needs 1 cell filled. It can only be in Row 5.\n- Column 4 and 5 need 2 cells filled. They can be in Row 4 and 5.\n\nThus, the final configuration aligns correctly with Option B.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{B}\n\\]", "ground_truth": "B", "prompt": "You need to solve an Aquarium puzzle.\n\n**Aquarium Puzzle Rules:**\n1.  **The Grid:** The grid is divided into several regions called \"tanks\" by the thick colored (red) lines.\n2.  **The Goal:** Your goal is to fill some cells in the grid with \"water\".\n3.  **Water Levels:** Within each tank, water must settle at a uniform level.
