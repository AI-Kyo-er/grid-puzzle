So, Option B is invalid.\n\n### Option C:\n```\n2 7 3 8 4 9 5 1 6\n4 1 6 7 3 5 9 2 8\n5 8 9 2 1 6 4 3 7\n9 2 7 4 8 1 3 6 5\n1 5 4 6 2 3 7 8 9\n6 3 8 9 5 7 1 4 2\n8 4 1 5 9 2 6 7 3\n7 9 2 3 6 4 8 5 1\n3 6 5 1 7 8 2 9 4\n```\n\nLet's verify Option C step-by-step:\n\n- Rows: All rows have unique digits 1-9.\n- Columns: All columns have unique digits 1-9.\n- Subgrids: All 3x3 subgrids have unique digits 1-9.\n\nSince Option C passes all checks, it appears to be the correct solution.\n\n### Option D:\n```\n2 7 3 8 4 9 5 1 6\n4 1 6 7 3 5 9 2 8\n5 8 9 2 1 6 4 3 7\n1 2 7 4 8 1 3 6 5\n7 5 4 6 2 3 7 8 9\n6 3 8 9 5 7 1 4 2\n8 4 1 5 9 2 6 7 3\n7 9 2 3 6 4 8 5 1\n3 6 5 1 7 8 2 9 6\n```\n\nCheck row 4: `1 2 7 4 8 1 3 6 5` - it has two '1's. Check last column: It has two '6's. So, Option D is invalid.\n\nThus, the correct completed Sudoku grid is:\n\n\\boxed{C}", "ground_truth": "C", "prompt": "You need to solve a Sudoku puzzle of size 9x9.\n\n**Sudoku Puzzle Rules (9x9 grid):**\n1.  **The Grid:** The grid is a 9x9 square, further divided into each 3x3 subgrid (non-overlapping regions).\n2.  **The Goal:** Fill all empty cells in the grid with digits from 1 to 9.\n3.  **Constraints:** Each digit (1 to 9) must appear exactly once in:\n    a.
