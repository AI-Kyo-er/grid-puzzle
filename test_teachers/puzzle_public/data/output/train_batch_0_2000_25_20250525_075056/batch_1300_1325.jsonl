{"question_id": "kakuro_178", "response": "To solve this Kakuro puzzle, we'll use the rules provided and fill out the grid step by step. Let's consider the constraints given by each clue.\n\n### Start with the top row:\n- The clue \"15\" indicates the sum of the first two cells in the top row.\n- The clue \"17\" indicates the sum of the next two cells in the top row plus the bottom-right cell.\n- The clue \"8\" indicates the sum of the bottom-right cell alone.\n\n### Consider possible combinations:\n1. For the first clue \"15\", valid pairs using unique digits are (6, 9), (7, 8), (8, 7), (9, 6).\n   - Since no digit repeats within the same block, let's check for consistency.\n   \n2. For the second clue \"17\", considering the previous pairs, further constraints apply. We also have the third cell involved here which should add up correctly.\n\nLet's test the first pair (6, 9):\n- If the first two cells are 6 and 9, then the remaining cell in the first column needs to make the column sums work.\n\n3. For the third clue \"8\", the only option is (8) since it's a single cell.\n\nNow, test the configurations given in the options:\n\n### Option A:\n```\n4 5 3\n5 9 1\n6 3 4\n```\n- Check sums:\n  - Row 1: 4 + 5 + 3 = 12 ≠ 15 (Incorrect)\n\n### Option B:\n```\n4 4 3\n5 9 1\n4 3 4\n```\n- Check sums:\n  - Column 1: 4 + 5 + 4 = 13 ≠ 12 (Incorrect)\n\n### Option C:\n```\n4 8 3\n5 9 1\n6 3 4\n```\n- Check sums:\n  - Row 1: 4 + 8 + 3 = 15 ✔️\n  - Column 1: 4 + 5 + 6 = 15 ✔️\n  - Column 2: 8 + 9 + 3 = 20 ≠ 17 (Incorrect)\n\n### Option D:\n```\n4 5 3\n5 9 1\n9 3 4\n```\n- Check sums:\n  - Row 1: 4 + 5 + 3 = 12 ≠ 15 (Incorrect)\n\nThus, only Option C seems closest but still has an inconsistency.
