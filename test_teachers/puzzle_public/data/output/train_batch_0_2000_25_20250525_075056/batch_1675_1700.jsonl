The red squares will be filled with `1` and the blue squares with `0`. Here is the grid so far based on the image:\n\n```\n? ? ? ?\n? ? ? 1\n? ? 0 ?\n0 ? 0 ?\n```\n\n### Step-by-step solving process\n\n#### Step 1: Fill known cells and check constraints\nWe already have:\n- Bottom left square: `0`\n- Middle right square: `1`\n- Third row third column: `0`\n- Fourth row second column: `0`\n\n#### Step 2: Check each row and column for possible values while adhering to the rules.\n\n##### Fill bottom row:\nThe bottom row has a `0` at the start and another `0` in the middle. The rule states that there can't be three consecutive identical numbers. Therefore, the remaining cells must alternate to satisfy both equality and non-consecutive rules.\n\n```\n0 1 0 1\n```\n\nThis checks out since it meets all criteria.\n\n##### Fill third row:\nThird row must have `0` in the third column. Since we cannot have three consecutive identical numbers, and need equal `0` and `1`, the options are limited. \n\n```\n1 0 0 1\n```\n\nThis configuration works.\n\n##### Fill second row:\nSecond row ends with a `1`. We also need to ensure equal count and non-consecutive numbers.\n\n```\n0 1 1 0\n```\n\nThis configuration works.\n\n##### Fill top row:\nTop row needs to balance remaining counts while ensuring uniqueness compared to other rows.\n\n```\n1 0 1 0\n```\n\nThis configuration works.\n\n### Step 3: Verify final grid:\nLet’s compile our findings into a full grid:\n\n```\n1 0 1 0\n0 1 1 0\n1 0 0 1\n0 1 0 1\n```\n\n### Step 4: Compare with options:\nThe correct grid matches Option A:\n\n```\n1 0 1 0\n0 1 1 0\n1 0 0 1\n0 1 0 1\n```\n\nThus, the correct answer is \\boxed{A}.", "ground_truth": "A", "prompt": "You need to solve a Binairo puzzle.\n\n**Binairo Puzzle Rules:**\n1.
