The rightmost cell of the tank is filled.\n   - Configuration: `0 0 0 0 1`\n\n3. **Third Row (Row 2):**\n   - Clue: 1\n   - Similarly, the only possible way is to fill the rightmost cell of the tank.\n   - Configuration: `0 0 0 0 1`\n\n4. **Fourth Row (Row 3):**\n   - Clue: 3\n   - To satisfy the clue, three cells must be filled. Since the tank spans three columns, fill the last three cells.\n   - Configuration: `0 0 1 1 1`\n\n5. **Fifth Row (Row 4):**\n   - Clue: 4\n   - All four cells in the tank should be filled as per the clue.\n   - Configuration: `0 1 1 1 1`\n\n#### Step 3: Verify the Column Constraints.\n\n- **Column 0:** Clue = 0 -> Satisfied.\n- **Column 1:** Clue = 1 -> Satisfied (filled in Row 4).\n- **Column 2:** Clue = 2 -> Satisfied (filled in Rows 3 and 4).\n- **Column 3:** Clue = 2 -> Satisfied (filled in Rows 3 and 4).\n- **Column 4:** Clue = 4 -> Satisfied (filled in Rows 1, 2, 3, and 4).\n\nThus, the correct configuration matches Option D:\n\n```\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 1\n0 0 0 0 1\n0 0 1 1 1\n0 1 1 1 1\n```\n\nSo, the final answer is \\boxed{D}.", "ground_truth": "D", "prompt": "You need to solve an Aquarium puzzle.\n\n**Aquarium Puzzle Rules:**\n1.  **The Grid:** The grid is divided into several regions called \"tanks\" by the thick colored (red) lines.\n2.  **The Goal:** Your goal is to fill some cells in the grid with \"water\".\n3.  **Water Levels:** Within each tank, water must settle at a uniform level. This means: if a cell is filled with water, all cells directly below it *within the same tank* must also be filled, down to the bottom of that tank.\n4.  **Clues:** The numbers outside the grid indicate how many cells *in total* must be filled with water in that specific row (numbers on the left) or column (numbers on the top).\n5.  **Solving:** Use the numbers as clues to figure out which cells must be filled with water, ensuring that the water level rule within each tank is followed, until all numbers are satisfied.\n\n\nYour task is to choose the correct grid configuration from the options below that represents the solution to the puzzle.
