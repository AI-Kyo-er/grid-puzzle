Row 3 and 4 together have a combined clue of 2 + 3 = 5, meaning all cells in Row 3 and 4 should be filled in this tank.\n\n#### Tank 3 (Rightmost):\n- Cells span across column 4.\n- Rows involved: All four rows.\n- Clues relevant: Column clue 2 and row clues 0, 0, 2, 3.\n- To satisfy the column clue of 2, two cells must be filled.
