Since the tanks are not full, the only possible position is in the first column (1 0 0 0).\n- **Column 0**: Needs 3 filled cells. Row 1 already has one, so we need two more. Therefore, Row 3 and Row 4 will have filled cells (1 1 1 1).\n- **Row 3**: Needs 3 filled cells. We already know the first column is filled. The second and third columns need to be filled as well because they form a continuous tank. So, Row 3 becomes (1 1 1 0).\n- **Row 4**: Needs 4 filled cells. So, all cells in this row will be filled (1 1 1 1).\n- **Column 1**: Needs 2 filled cells. Row 3 and Row 4 already satisfy this.\n- **Column 2**: Needs 2 filled cells. Row 3 and Row 4 already satisfy this.\n- **Column 3**: Needs 1 filled cell.
