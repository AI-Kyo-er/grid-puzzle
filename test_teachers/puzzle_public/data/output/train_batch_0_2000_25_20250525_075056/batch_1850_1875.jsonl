Since there are 4 cells per row/column, we need exactly 2 of each.\n\n### Step 3: Apply Rule 2 (No More Than Two Consecutive Identical Numbers)\n\nWe ensure that no row or column has three consecutive 0s or 1s.\n\n### Step 4: Fill the Grid\n\n#### Row 1:\n```\n0 _ _ 1\n```\nThis row already has one 0 and one 1. So the remaining cells must be one 0 and one 1.\nTo avoid consecutive numbers, possible valid configurations are:\n- `0 1 0 1`\n- `0 0 1 1` (invalid because it would make two 1s consecutive with the next row)\nSo the valid row is:\n```\n0 1 0 1\n```\n\n#### Row 2:\n```\n_ _ 1 1\n```\nThis row already has two 1s. So the remaining cells must both be 0s:\n```\n0 0 1 1\n```\n\n#### Row 3:\n```\n_ _ _ _\n```\nThis row needs two 0s and two 1s and should not match any other row.

{"question_id": "aquarium_332", "response": "To solve this Aquarium puzzle, let's go through the steps systematically:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Tanks\nThere are four tanks separated by red lines. We'll label these tanks for clarity:\n- Tank 1: Top-left corner extending down two rows.\n- Tank 2: Top-center extending down two rows.\n- Tank 3: Top-right corner extending down two rows.\n- Tank 4: Bottom-left and bottom-center extending down one row each.\n\n### Step 2: Check Row and Column Constraints\n\n#### Row Constraints:\n- Row 1: 1 (one cell filled with water)\n- Row 2: 2 (two cells filled with water)\n- Row 3: 2 (two cells filled with water)\n- Row 4: 4 (all four cells filled with water)\n\n#### Column Constraints:\n- Column 1: 4 (all four cells filled with water)\n- Column 2: 1 (one cell filled with water)\n- Column 3: 1 (one cell filled with water)\n- Column 4: 3 (three cells filled with water)\n\n\n### Step 3: Fill the Water Based on Constraints\n\n#### Tank 1 Analysis:\n- Tank 1 spans Row 1 and Row 2, Column 1 and Column 2.\n- Since Column 1 needs 4 water-filled cells, Rows 1, 2, 3, and 4 must be filled in Column 1.\n- Row 1 has only one water cell, so only Cell(1,1) is filled in Tank 1.\n- Row 2 has two water cells, so Cells(2,1) and (2,2) must be filled.\n\n#### Tank 2 Analysis:\n- Tank 2 spans Row 1 and Row 2, Column 3.\n- Column 3 needs only 1 water-filled cell, so it goes in either Row 1 or Row 2.\n- Row 1 already has one water cell, thus fulfilling its constraint.\n- Thus, Cell(1,3) cannot be filled, and no water can be added in Tank 2.\n\n#### Tank 3 Analysis:\n- Tank 3 spans Row 1 and Row 2, Column 4.\n- Column 4 needs three water-filled cells, but not more than one can come from Row 1 as it would exceed Row 1's constraint.\n- So, Cell(1,4) is empty and Cell(2,4) must be filled.\n- Thus, Cells(3,4) and (4,4) must be filled.\n\n#### Tank 4 Analysis:\n- Tank 4 spans Row 3 and Row 4, Column 1, 2, and 3.\n- Column 1, 2, and 3 already have their filled water cells as per previous analysis.\n- Row 4 needs all cells filled, so Cells(4,1), (4,2), (4,3), and (4,4) are filled.\n\n### Step 4: Verify the Solution\nBy filling as per above logic, we get:\n\n```\n1 0 0 0\n1 0 0 1\n1 0 0 1\n1 1 1 1\n```\n\nThis matches Option D perfectly.\n\nThus, the correct answer is \\(\\boxed{D}\\).", "ground_truth": "D", "prompt": "You need to solve an Aquarium puzzle.\n\n**Aquarium Puzzle Rules:**\n1.  **The Grid:** The grid is divided into several regions called \"tanks\" by the thick colored (red) lines.\n2.  **The Goal:** Your goal is to fill some cells in the grid with \"water\".\n3.  **Water Levels:** Within each tank, water must settle at a uniform level.
