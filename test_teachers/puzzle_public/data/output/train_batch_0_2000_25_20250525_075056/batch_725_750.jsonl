Possible combinations without repeating digits are:\n- (1, 2, 5)\n- (1, 3, 4)\n\nSince the third row sums to 11, which is too small to fit 5, we select (1, 3, 4). So we fill:\n- Top-left cell: 1\n- Middle-left cell: 3\n- Bottom-left cell: 4\n\n#### Second Column:\nThe second column must sum to 16.

Given the constraints, the first cell will be filled because the entire tank needs to adhere to the water level rule. \n   - Hence, the first row will be `1 0 0 0 0 0`.\n\n2. **Second Row (1x6):**\n   - Row Clue: 1\n   - Similar to the first row, only the first cell can be filled with water due to the tank boundary.\n   - Hence, the second row will be `1 0 0 0 0 0`.\n\n3. **Third Row (1x6):**\n   - Row Clue: 1\n   - Following similar reasoning, only the first cell will be filled with water.\n   - Hence, the third row will be `1 0 0 0 0 0`.\n\n4. **Fourth Row (6x6):**\n   - Row Clue: 6\n   - Since the clue is 6, all six cells in this row will be filled with water.\n   - Hence, the fourth row will be `1 1 1 1 1 1`.\n\n5. **Fifth Row (6x6):**\n   - Row Clue: 6\n   - Similarly, all six cells in this row will be filled with water.\n   - Hence, the fifth row will be `1 1 1 1 1 1`.\n\n6. **Sixth Row (6x6):**\n   - Row Clue: 6\n   - All six cells in this row will be filled with water.\n   - Hence, the sixth row will be `1 1 1 1 1 1`.\n\n### Verifying Against Column Clues\n\nNow, let's verify the filled cells against the column clues:\n\n1. **First Column:**\n   - Column Clue: 6\n   - The first column has `1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1` which sums up to 6.\n   \n2. **Second Column:**\n   - Column Clue: 3\n   - The second column has `0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1` which sums up to 3.\n\n3. **Third Column:**\n   - Column Clue: 3\n   - The third column has `0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1` which sums up to 3.\n\n4. **Fourth Column:**\n   - Column Clue: 3\n   - The fourth column has `0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1` which sums up to 3.\n\n5. **Fifth Column:**\n   - Column Clue: 3\n   - The fifth column has `0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1` which sums up to 3.\n\n6. **Sixth Column:**\n   - Column Clue: 3\n   - The sixth column has `0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1` which sums up to 3.\n\nAll the columns match their respective clues. \n\nThus, the correct configuration is Option D.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{D}\n\\]", "ground_truth": "D", "prompt": "You need to solve an Aquarium puzzle.\n\n**Aquarium Puzzle Rules:**\n1.  **The Grid:** The grid is divided into several regions called \"tanks\" by the thick colored (red) lines.\n2.  **The Goal:** Your goal is to fill some cells in the grid with \"water\".\n3.  **Water Levels:** Within each tank, water must settle at a uniform level.
