Since these rows overlap in the same tank, and there are no other constraints within the tank, the first three cells in both rows should be filled with water.\n  \n- **Row 3, 4, 5**: Each has a clue of `3`. These rows are in separate tanks. Each will have its own set of three cells filled with water, starting from the leftmost possible position to satisfy the water level rule.\n\n- **Row 6**: The clue is `6`, meaning all six cells in this row must be filled with water.\n\n#### Column Analysis:\n- **Columns 1, 2, 3**: Each has a clue of `6`. This implies that all cells in these columns must be filled with water since they span the full height of their respective tanks.\n\n- **Column 4**: Clue is `1`. Only one cell in this column needs to be filled, but it cannot be in the lower part of the tank because it would require more than one cell due to the water level rule.
