{"question_id": "aquarium_200", "response": "To solve the given Aquarium puzzle, let's follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the puzzle and its rules\n\n- **Tanks:** The red lines divide the grid into tanks. Water fills uniformly within each tank.\n- **Clues:** Numbers outside the grid indicate the number of water-filled cells in a row or column.\n- **Uniform filling:** If a cell in a tank is filled, all cells below it within the same tank must also be filled.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the clues\n\n#### Top clues (columns):\n- Column 0: 0 - No cells should contain water.\n- Column 1: 1 - One cell should contain water.\n- Column 2: 5 - All five cells should contain water.\n- Column 3: 2 - Two cells should contain water.\n- Column 4: 2 - Two cells should contain water.\n\n#### Left clues (rows):\n- Row 0: 1 - One cell should contain water.\n- Row 1: 1 - One cell should contain water.\n- Row 2: 1 - One cell should contain water.\n- Row 3: 3 - Three cells should contain water.\n- Row 4: 4 - Four cells should contain water.\n\n### Step 3: Fill the grid based on the clues\n\n#### Column 2:\n- Since all 5 cells must be filled, mark them as water.\n- Updated table:\n```\n_ _ W W _\n_ _ W _ _\n_ _ W _ _\n_ _ W _ _\n_ _ W W W\n```\n\n#### Column 0:\n- No water in this column.\n- Confirm no change needed.\n\n#### Columns 3 and 4:\n- We know two cells should have water for both columns. But since the water must be uniform, we can only place water in the lower part of the tanks spanning these columns.\n- Row 3 has three cells to be filled, putting water in the bottom-right cells of columns 3 and 4.\n\n#### Row clues verification:\n- Row 0: The required one water cell is already placed in column 2.\n- Row 1: The required one water cell is already placed in column 2.\n- Row 2: The required one water cell is already placed in column 2.\n- Row 3: Three water cells in the bottom right section (columns 2, 3, 4).\n- Row 4: Four water cells in columns 1, 2, 3, 4.\n\n### Step 4: Compare with the provided options\n\nUsing the above analysis, compare with the given options:\n\n**Option A:**\n```\n0 0 1 1 0\n0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 1 1 0\n0 0 1 1 1\n0 1 1 1 1\n```\nThis does not match our analysis for rows and columns.\n\n**Option B:**\n```\n0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0\n1 0 1 1 1\n0 1 1 1 1\n```\nThis matches our analysis better but has a water cell misstep in row 3.\n\n**Option C:**\n```\n0 0 1 0 0\n1 0 1 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1\n```\nExtra water in row 1.\n\n**Option D:**\n```\n0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 1 1 1\n0 1 1 1 1\n```\nThis perfectly matches our analysis.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThus, the correct grid configuration is Option D.\n\n\\boxed{D}", "ground_truth": "D", "prompt": "You need to solve an Aquarium puzzle.\n\n**Aquarium Puzzle Rules:**\n1.  **The Grid:** The grid is divided into several regions called \"tanks\" by the thick colored (red) lines.\n2.  **The Goal:** Your goal is to fill some cells in the grid with \"water\".\n3.  **Water Levels:** Within each tank, water must settle at a uniform level.
