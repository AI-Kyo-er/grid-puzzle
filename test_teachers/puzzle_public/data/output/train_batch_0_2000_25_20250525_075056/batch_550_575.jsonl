Let's consider possible placements:\n     - Tank 1: Only two cells max (not enough for three).\n     - Therefore, at least one cell must be in the bottom-right tank.\n   - Since the water level must be uniform, all three cells could be in the bottom-right tank, but that would conflict with other clues.\n   - Hence, two cells are in the top-left tank, and one in the bottom-right tank.\n\n3. **Column 3 and Column 4:**\n   - Both have 0 filled cells, so all cells remain empty.\n\n4. **Row 4:**\n   - Requires two filled cells. This fits nicely in the bottom-right tank (as the top-left cannot accommodate more than one additional cell without conflict).\n\n#### Step 4: Verify the solution\n\nAfter trying the options, Option D matches our deductions:\n```\n0 0 0 0\n0 1 0 0\n0 1 0 0\n1 1 0 0\n```\n\nThis configuration matches all the row and column clues while maintaining uniform water levels within each tank.\n\nThus, the correct option is \\boxed{D}.", "ground_truth": "D", "prompt": "You need to solve an Aquarium puzzle.\n\n**Aquarium Puzzle Rules:**\n1.  **The Grid:** The grid is divided into several regions called \"tanks\" by the thick colored (red) lines.\n2.  **The Goal:** Your goal is to fill some cells in the grid with \"water\".\n3.  **Water Levels:** Within each tank, water must settle at a uniform level.

{"question_id": "aquarium_285", "response": "To solve this Aquarium puzzle, we need to follow the given rules and analyze the clues provided on the top and left sides of the grid. Let’s go through the steps methodically.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n\n#### 1. **Analyze the Tanks**\nThere are five tanks separated by the red lines:\n- First tank: Top-left corner spanning two rows and one column.\n- Second tank: Top-right corner spanning one row and three columns.\n- Third tank: Middle-right spanning two rows and three columns.\n- Fourth tank: Bottom-left spanning two rows and two columns.\n- Fifth tank: Bottom-right spanning two rows and two columns.\n\n#### 2. **Examine Row and Column Clues**\n\n##### Row Clues:\n- Row 1: 1 water cell\n- Row 2: 1 water cell\n- Row 3: 4 water cells\n- Row 4: 4 water cells\n\n##### Column Clues:\n- Column 1: 4 water cells\n- Column 2: 2 water cells\n- Column 3: 2 water cells\n- Column 4: 2 water cells\n\n#### 3. **Determine Water Levels in Each Tank**\n\n##### First Tank (Top-left):\n- Clue for the first row is 1 water cell.\n- The only way to satisfy this clue while respecting the water-level rule is to place water in the top-left cell of the first tank.\n- This also satisfies the first column's clue of 4 water cells since it must continue to the bottom.\n\n##### Second Tank (Top-right):\n- Clue for the first row already has its 1 water cell used, so the remaining cells in the first row of the second tank must remain empty.\n- The second row has a clue of 1 water cell. Since no water was placed in the first column of the second tank in the first row, the water can only be placed in one of the next three available cells in the second row, starting from the second column.\n\n##### Third Tank (Middle-right):\n- Clue for the third row is 4 water cells. The entire row needs to be filled with water since it spans one tank.\n- The fourth row also needs 4 water cells, and since the cells from the previous row are connected in the same tank, they must all be filled too.\n\n##### Fourth Tank (Bottom-left):\n- No water is required in this tank based on the filled nature of the adjacent tanks and the remaining clues.\n\n##### Fifth Tank (Bottom-right):\n- The fifth tank must have water up to the second row to satisfy the overall column clues.\n\n### Check Against Options:\n\nBased on our analysis:\n- Option A does not match our solution since it places water incorrectly.\n- Option B matches our logical placement of water.\n- Option C and D do not satisfy the row and column clues correctly.\n\nThus, the correct solution is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{B}\n\\]", "ground_truth": "B", "prompt": "You need to solve an Aquarium puzzle.\n\n**Aquarium Puzzle Rules:**\n1.  **The Grid:** The grid is divided into several regions called \"tanks\" by the thick colored (red) lines.\n2.  **The Goal:** Your goal is to fill some cells in the grid with \"water\".\n3.  **Water Levels:** Within each tank, water must settle at a uniform level. This means: if a cell is filled with water, all cells directly below it *within the same tank* must also be filled, down to the bottom of that tank.\n4.  **Clues:** The numbers outside the grid indicate how many cells *in total* must be filled with water in that specific row (numbers on the left) or column (numbers on the top).\n5.  **Solving:** Use the numbers as clues to figure out which cells must be filled with water, ensuring that the water level rule within each tank is followed, until all numbers are satisfied.\n\n\nYour task is to choose the correct grid configuration from the options below that represents the solution to the puzzle.

To balance it needs two more 0's and 1's and avoid three consecutive numbers.\n- The only valid sequence for the rest of the second row: `0 0 1 1`.\n\nSo, the second row becomes:\n```\n0 0 1 1\n```\n\n**Step 3: Fill out the third row**\n- We need to make sure it follows the rules and doesn't repeat the patterns from the first two rows.\n- One possible sequence for the third row: `0 1 1 0`.\n\nSo, the third row becomes:\n```\n0 1 1 0\n```\n\n**Step 4: Fill out the fourth row**\n- Finally, we need to fill the last row which should also follow the rules and not repeat any sequence from previous rows.\n- The only remaining valid sequence for the fourth row: `1 1 0 0`.\n\nSo, the fourth row becomes:\n```\n1 1 0 0\n```\n\nCombining all, our final grid looks like:\n```\n1 0 0 1\n0 0 1 1\n0 1 1 0\n1 1 0 0\n```\n\nThus, the correct option is **Option A**.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{A}\n\\]", "ground_truth": "A", "prompt": "You need to solve a Binairo puzzle.\n\n**Binairo Puzzle Rules:**\n1.
