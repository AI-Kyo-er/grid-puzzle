{"question_id": "kakuro_573", "response": "Let's solve the Kakuro puzzle step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Clues\n\nThe clues indicate the sums for the rows and columns. Let's break down the top row and leftmost column.\n\n- Top row: `30`, `30`, `21`, `30`, `20`\n- Leftmost column: `23`, `28`, `27`, `23`, `30`\n\n### Step 2: Try Filling with Logic\n\n#### Top Row Analysis:\n- The first two blocks have to sum up to `30` each. Since we can only use unique digits from 1-9, possible combinations for `30` are limited. One common valid combination is `[9, 8, 7, 6]`.\n- The next block has a sum of `21`. Possible combinations include `[9, 8, 4]` or `[9, 7, 5]` etc.\n\n#### Left Column Analysis:\n- First block: `23` needs four digits. Possible combinations could be `[9, 8, 6, 0]` but since we cannot use `0`, another possible set is `[9, 8, 5, 1]`.\n\n### Step 3: Cross-Verification and Filtering\n\nWe will now look at the provided solutions (options A, B, C, D). We'll check which one satisfies the initial sections of our analysis.\n\n#### Option A Analysis:\n```\n4 1 1 2 9\n9 9 3 5 2\n2 6 7 9 3\n7 5 7 5 1\n8 3 8 6 5\n```\n- Issues: Repeated `1` in the first row; no valid solution.\n\n#### Option B Analysis:\n```\n4 6 1 2 9\n9 9 3 5 2\n2 6 7 3 3\n7 5 4 8 1\n8 3 8 6 5\n```\n- Issues: Repeated `9` in second row; repeated `3` in third row.\n\n#### Option C Analysis:\n```\n4 7 1 2 9\n9 9 3 5 8\n2 6 7 9 3\n7 5 2 8 1\n8 3 8 6 5\n```\n- Issues: Repeated `9` in second row.\n\n#### Option D Analysis:\n```\n4 7 1 2 9\n9 9 3 5 2\n2 6 7 9 3\n7 5 2 8 1\n8 3 8 6 5\n```\n- Issues: Repeated `9` in second row.\n\nNone of these options seem ideal without further adjustments, but if constrained to options provided, let's cross-check again.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven all options, Option D is the closest match after filtering out immediate issues of repeats.\n\nThus the Answer is \\boxed{D}.", "ground_truth": "D", "prompt": "You need to solve a 5x5 Kakuro puzzle.\n\n**Kakuro Puzzle Rules (5x5 Grid):**\n1. **Grid:** The grid is a 5x5 square, containing blank cells and clue cells.\n2. **Objective:** Fill all blank cells with numbers from 1 to 9.\n3. **Constraints:** Each digit (1 to 9) must satisfy the following conditions:\n    a.
