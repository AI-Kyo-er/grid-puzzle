The large tank spans the first three columns and the entire height, while the smaller tank spans the last two columns and the entire height.\n- Row clues: [0, 2, 2, 2, 2]\n- Column clues: [0, 0, 0, 4, 4]\n\n#### Fill the tanks following the water level rule:\n\n1. **Columns 4 and 5 (last two columns):**\n   - Both columns have a clue of '4'.\n   - The smaller tank spans all rows (5 rows tall).\n   - To satisfy the column clues, both columns must be completely filled with water in all their cells.\n\n   Hence, the last two columns should look like:\n   ```\n   0 0 | 1 1\n   0 0 | 1 1\n   0 0 | 1 1\n   0 0 | 1 1\n   0 0 | 1 1\n   ```\n\n2. **Verify Rows with the given clues:**\n   - Row 1 has a clue of '0', so no cells should be filled.\n   - Rows 2 through 5 have a clue of '2', meaning exactly two cells per row must be filled.\n   - Since the last two columns of these rows are already filled entirely as determined above, these satisfy the clue for rows 2 through 5 perfectly.\n\n#### Final Check:\nWe now check all given options:\n\n- **Option A:**\n  ```\n  0 0 0 0 0\n  0 0 0 1 1\n  0 0 0 1 1\n  0 0 0 1 1\n  0 0 0 1 1\n  ```\n  - Fits both row and column clues.

Thus, Option B is incorrect.\n\n#### Option C:\nCheck the second row of Option C:\n```plaintext\n5 7 2 6 1 4 8 9 3\n```\nThis row looks fine, but carefully checking other rows, columns, and subgrids reveals no immediate violations.\n\n#### Option D:\nCheck the bottom-right corner of Option D:\n```plaintext\n6 5 9 7 2 8 4 1 9\n```\nThe digit '9' appears twice in this row, making it invalid according to Sudoku rules. Thus, Option D is incorrect.\n\n### Conclusion:\nAfter verifying all options, only **Option A** satisfies all Sudoku constraints properly.
