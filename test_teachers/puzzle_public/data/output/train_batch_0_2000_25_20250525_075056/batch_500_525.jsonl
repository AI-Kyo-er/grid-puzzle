{"question_id": "aquarium_129", "response": "We will solve this Aquarium puzzle by following the rules and analyzing the clues given for rows and columns.\n\n#### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify Tanks and Constraints:**\n\n   - There are two tanks in the grid: one on the left covering two columns (columns 1 and 2), and another on the right covering four columns (columns 3, 4, 5, and 6).\n   \n2. **Analyze Row Constraints:**\n\n   - Row 1 has a clue of 2, meaning exactly 2 cells should be filled with water in this row.\n   - Row 2 has a clue of 2, indicating exactly 2 cells should be filled with water in this row.\n   - Row 3 has a clue of 2, indicating exactly 2 cells should be filled with water in this row.\n   - Row 4 has a clue of 2, indicating exactly 2 cells should be filled with water in this row.\n   - Row 5 has a clue of 3, indicating exactly 3 cells should be filled with water in this row.\n   - Row 6 has a clue of 6, indicating all 6 cells should be filled with water in this row.\n\n3. **Analyze Column Constraints:**\n\n   - Column 1 has a clue of 6, indicating all 6 cells should be filled with water.\n   - Column 2 has a clue of 6, indicating all 6 cells should be filled with water.\n   - Column 3 has a clue of 2, indicating exactly 2 cells should be filled with water.\n   - Column 4 has a clue of 1, indicating exactly 1 cell should be filled with water.\n   - Column 5 has a clue of 1, indicating exactly 1 cell should be filled with water.\n   - Column 6 has a clue of 1, indicating exactly 1 cell should be filled with water.\n\n4. **Filling the Grid According to the Clues:**\n\n   - Rows 1, 2, 3, and 4 are part of the left tank, which spans two columns (1 and 2). Since both columns have a clue of 6, these rows must be fully filled in both columns.\n   - Row 5 has a clue of 3. It can be deduced by looking at the columns that only the first three cells of this row need to be filled.\n   - Row 6 is entirely filled due to the clue of 6 in both columns 1 and 2.\n\n   Considering the right tank:\n\n   - For columns 3, 4, 5, and 6: Due to their clues, only the first few cells in some rows could be filled.
