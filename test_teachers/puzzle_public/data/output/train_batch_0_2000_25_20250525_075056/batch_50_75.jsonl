{"question_id": "aquarium_8", "response": "To solve this Aquarium puzzle, we need to carefully follow the given rules and ensure that the water fills uniformly within each tank according to the clues provided.\n\n### Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n#### Analyze the grid and tanks:\n\n1. The grid is divided into three tanks by the red lines. \n   - Tank 1 covers columns 1-2 and rows 1-2.\n   - Tank 2 covers columns 3-4 and rows 1-2.\n   - Tank 3 spans the entire third and fourth rows across all columns.\n\n2. The numbers outside the grid give us the necessary water count for each row and column.\n\n#### Row and Column Clues:\n\n- Row 0 has '0' indicating no water.\n- Row 1 has '0' indicating no water.\n- Row 2 has '2' indicating two water cells.\n- Row 3 has '3' indicating three water cells.\n\n- Column 0 has '2' indicating two water cells in total.\n- Column 1 has '0' indicating no water.\n- Column 2 has '1' indicating one water cell in total.\n- Column 3 has '2' indicating two water cells in total.\n\n#### Filling the water based on clues:\n\n1. **Row 0 and Row 1 have '0'**, so none of these cells can have water.\n   - Thus, the first two rows will remain empty: \n     ```\n     0 0 0 0\n     0 0 0 0\n     ```\n\n2. **Row 2 requires 2 water cells** within its span across all columns. Given the tank constraint and other clues:\n   - We fill the last two cells (columns 3 and 4 in row 2) with water:\n     ```\n     0 0 0 0\n     0 0 0 0\n     0 0 1 1\n     ```\n\n3. **Row 3 needs 3 water cells**. Since the second column cannot have water and only one more water cell can be added in column 0:\n   - We place water in columns 0, 2, and 4 of row 3:\n     ```\n     0 0 0 0\n     0 0 0 0\n     0 0 1 1\n     1 0 1 1\n     ```\n\nThis matches Option C exactly:\n```\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 1\n1 0 1 1\n```\n\nThus, the correct solution is:\n\n\\boxed{C}", "ground_truth": "D", "prompt": "You need to solve an Aquarium puzzle.\n\n**Aquarium Puzzle Rules:**\n1.  **The Grid:** The grid is divided into several regions called \"tanks\" by the thick colored (red) lines.\n2.  **The Goal:** Your goal is to fill some cells in the grid with \"water\".\n3.  **Water Levels:** Within each tank, water must settle at a uniform level.

Analyze the Row and Column Constraints\n\n- **Row Constraints**: \n    - Row 1 has 0 filled cells.\n    - Row 2 has 0 filled cells.\n    - Row 3 has 2 filled cells.\n    - Row 4 has 5 filled cells.\n    - Row 5 has 5 filled cells.\n\n- **Column Constraints**:\n    - Column 1 has 2 filled cells.\n    - Column 2 has 3 filled cells.\n    - Column 3 has 2 filled cells.\n    - Column 4 has 3 filled cells.\n    - Column 5 has 2 filled cells.\n\n#### 2. Apply the Water Level Rule and Constraints\n\n- **Rows 1 and 2 (0 filled cells)**: These rows should have no filled cells since their constraint is 0.\n  \n  So, for Rows 1 and 2:\n  ```\n  [0 0 0 0 0]\n  [0 0 0 0 0]\n  ```\n\n- **Row 3 (2 filled cells)**: This row has a tank that spans columns 2 and 3.
