{"question_id": "aquarium_668", "response": "To solve this Aquarium puzzle, let's break down the process according to the given rules and clues.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n\n#### Step 1: Understanding the Tanks and Clues\nWe have 4 tanks defined by the thick red lines. The clue numbers for rows and columns will help us determine the water levels.\n\n#### Step 2: Analyzing Row Clues\n- **Row 1 and 2**: Both have a clue `2`. In these two rows, there are two cells that can be part of the water level in the leftmost tank. Since water must settle uniformly, both rows should have the first two columns filled with water.\n- **Row 3, 4, and 5**: Row 3 has a clue `2`, Row 4 has no clue (`0`), and Row 5 has a clue `5`. The last three rows are part of the larger tank. For Row 5 with `5`, all five cells must be filled. Thus, to satisfy the water level consistency, Rows 3 and 4 should also be filled up to their respective uniform levels.\n\n#### Step 3: Verifying Column Clues\n- **Columns 1 and 2**: Both have a clue `5`. These indicate that all five cells in both columns should be filled with water. This matches our previous conclusion for rows.\n- **Columns 3, 4, and 5**: All have a clue `1`. This means only one cell per column should be filled with water. Considering the tank structure, it makes sense that the water fills up to the bottom of the smallest tank per column which aligns with the last row being filled.\n\n### Final Configuration Check\nGiven the analysis above, we should have:\n- First two columns filled in all rows.\n- Third, fourth, and fifth columns filled only in the last row.\n\nNow comparing our derived configuration with the given options:\n\n#### Option A\n```\n1 1 0 0 0\n1 1 0 0 0\n0 1 0 0 0\n1 1 0 0 0\n1 1 1 1 1\n```\n- Doesn't match as third row second column should not have a `1`.\n\n#### Option B\n```\n1 1 0 0 0\n1 1 0 0 0\n1 1 0 0 0\n1 1 0 0 0\n1 1 1 1 1\n```\n- Matches perfectly because all rows follow the uniform water level rule and all clues are satisfied.\n\n#### Option C\n```\n1 1 0 0 0\n1 0 0 0 0\n1 1 0 0 0\n1 1 0 0 0\n1 1 1 1 1\n```\n- Doesn't match as the second row should have the first two columns filled.\n\n#### Option D\n```\n1 1 0 0 0\n1 1 0 0 1\n1 1 0 0 0\n1 1 0 0 0\n1 1 1 1 1\n```\n- Doesn't match as the second row third column should not be filled.\n\nThus, the correct option is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{B}\n\\]", "ground_truth": "B", "prompt": "You need to solve an Aquarium puzzle.\n\n**Aquarium Puzzle Rules:**\n1.  **The Grid:** The grid is divided into several regions called \"tanks\" by the thick colored (red) lines.\n2.  **The Goal:** Your goal is to fill some cells in the grid with \"water\".\n3.  **Water Levels:** Within each tank, water must settle at a uniform level.

Column Clues Analysis:\n- Column 5 has a clue of `2`: This column needs 2 filled cells. Looking at the tank and the filled cells from row analysis, the last two cells in this column can be filled.\n- Other columns do not have any filled cells based on the current analysis.\n\n#### 4.
