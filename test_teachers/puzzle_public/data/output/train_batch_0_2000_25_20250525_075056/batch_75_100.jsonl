Since four cells need to be filled per column, water levels will extend from row 3 (bottom) up to row 2.\n\n### Step 3: Fill the Grid Based on Clues and Water Level Rules\n\nBy applying the above deductions:\n\n```\n0 0 0 0 0 0   # Row 1: Filled 0 cells\n0 0 0 0 0 0   # Row 2: Filled 0 cells\n0 0 0 0 1 1   # Row 3: Filled 2 cells (Columns 5 and 6)\n0 0 0 1 1 1   # Row 4: Filled 3 cells (Column 4 filled + Column 5 and 6 continuing)\n0 0 0 1 1 1   # Row 5: Filled 3 cells (Continuing from previous rows)\n0 0 0 1 1 1   # Row 6: Filled 3 cells (Continuing from previous rows)\n```\n\n### Step 4: Verify the Solution\n\n- Rows: \n    - Row 1 and 2 are empty as expected.\n    - Row 3 has 2 filled cells.\n    - Rows 4, 5, and 6 each have 3 filled cells.\n- Columns:\n    - Columns 1, 2, and 3 are empty as expected.\n    - Column 4 has 3 filled cells.\n    - Columns 5 and 6 each have 4 filled cells.\n\nThis matches all given clues perfectly.\n\n### Step 5: Match with Provided Options\n\nThe derived solution corresponds exactly to Option A.\n\nHence, the correct answer is \\boxed{A}.", "ground_truth": "A", "prompt": "You need to solve an Aquarium puzzle.\n\n**Aquarium Puzzle Rules:**\n1.  **The Grid:** The grid is divided into several regions called \"tanks\" by the thick colored (red) lines.\n2.  **The Goal:** Your goal is to fill some cells in the grid with \"water\".\n3.  **Water Levels:** Within each tank, water must settle at a uniform level.
