{"question_id": "binairo_1081", "response": "To solve this Binairo puzzle, we'll follow these steps:\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n\n#### 1. Initial Setup and Constraints\n- The puzzle grid is 4x4.\n- Red squares represent `1`.\n- White squares represent `0`.\n- We need to place `0` and `1` in each empty space while adhering to the rules.\n\nGiven grid:\n```\n| . | . | 1 | . |\n| 1 | . | . | . |\n| . | 1 | 1 | . |\n| 1 | . | . | 1 |\n```\n\n#### 2. Applying Rule #2: No More Than Two Consecutive Identical Numbers\n- In Row 1: The third cell already has a `1`. Thus, the first and second cells cannot both be `1` (to avoid `111`), so at least one of them should be `0`.\n- In Row 2: The first cell already has a `1`, so the next two cells cannot be `1` consecutively, implying they should have at least one `0`.\n- In Row 3: The second and third cells both have `1`, thus fourth cell should be `0` (to avoid `111`).\n- In Row 4: The first and last cells have `1`, so the middle two cells should be `0` (to avoid `111`).\n\n#### 3. Applying Rule #3: Equal Number of 0s and 1s in Rows/Columns\n- Each row and each column should contain exactly two `0`s and two `1`s.\n\n#### 4. Solving the Grid\n\nLet's start filling in the grid while adhering to the rules:\n\n- Row 1: `. . 1 .` -> Possible configurations avoiding three consecutive `1`s and ensuring two `0`s and two `1`s: `0 0 1 1`.\n- Row 2: `1 . . .` -> To match the `1` count and avoid three consecutive `1`s: `1 1 0 0`.\n- Row 3: `. 1 1 .` -> To ensure two `0`s and two `1`s: `0 1 1 0`.\n- Row 4: `1 . . 1` -> To ensure two `0`s and two `1`s: `1 0 0 1`.\n\nNow checking the complete grid:\n```\n0 0 1 1\n1 1 0 0\n0 1 1 0\n1 0 0 1\n```\n\n#### 5.
