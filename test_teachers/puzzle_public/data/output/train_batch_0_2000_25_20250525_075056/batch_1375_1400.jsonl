We need to fill in the remaining cells according to the rules provided.\n\n2. **Grid Analysis:**\n\n   - The puzzle is a 4x4 grid.\n   - There should be exactly two 0's and two 1's in every row and column.\n   - No more than two consecutive identical numbers in any row or column.\n\n   Given the puzzle state:\n   ```\n   | | |1| |\n   | |1| |1|\n   |0|0| | |\n   | | | | |\n   ```\n\n3. **Filling the Remaining Cells:**\n\n   - Start with the first row: `| | |1| |`. Since there must be two 0's and two 1's, and we have one '1', we cannot put another '1' consecutively. The row needs to be completed as `1 1 0 0`.\n   \n   - Second row: `| |1| |1|`. We already have two '1's, so the other two must be '0's. The row becomes `0 1 0 1`.\n\n   - Third row: `|0|0| | |`. There must be two '1's. To avoid three consecutive '0's, place the '1's appropriately resulting in `0 0 1 1`.\n\n   - Fourth row: We need to complete this row ensuring it fits all rules and does not repeat any existing row. The row must be `1 0 1 0` since it satisfies the rule of having two '0's and two '1's without repeating any pattern.\n\n4. **Verification:**\n\n   Check if the final grid meets all conditions:\n   ```\n   1 1 0 0\n   0 1 0 1\n   0 0 1 1\n   1 0 1 0\n   ```\n\n   - Each row and column contains exactly two 0's and two 1's.\n   - No more than two consecutive identical numbers in any row or column.\n   - No two rows or columns are identical.\n\nThis matches Option A perfectly.

Apply the Clues to the Tank:\n\n##### Column Clues:\n- Columns 1, 2, and 3 have a clue of `0` each, meaning no cells in these columns will have water.\n- Column 4 has a clue of `4`, meaning 4 out of the 6 cells in this column will be filled with water.\n- Column 5 has a clue of `5`, meaning 5 out of the 6 cells in this column will be filled with water.\n\n##### Row Clues:\n- Row 1 has a clue of `1`, meaning 1 out of the 6 cells in this row will be filled with water.\n- Row 2 has a clue of `2`, meaning 2 out of the 6 cells in this row will be filled with water.\n- Rows 3, 4, 5, and 6 each have a clue of `2`, meaning 2 out of the 6 cells in each of these rows will be filled with water.\n\n#### 3.

Top-left tank (2x2 grid)\n2. Top-right tank (2x2 grid)\n3. Bottom-left tank (2x2 grid)\n4. Bottom-right tank (2x2 grid)\n\nThe numbers beside the grid give us the following clues:\n\n- Row 1: 2\n- Row 2: 2\n- Row 3: 4\n- Row 4: 4\n\n- Column 1: 4\n- Column 2: 4\n- Column 3: 2\n- Column 4: 2\n\n#### Step 2: Fill the tanks according to the clues\n\n##### Tank 1 (Top-left 2x2):\n- Clues for Row 1 and Row 2 require these two rows to have 2 cells filled each.\n- Clue for Column 1 and Column 2 requires these two columns to have 4 cells filled each.\n\nSince the water fills uniformly, both the first and second cells in the first and second rows should be filled.\n\nThus:\n- Cell (1,1) = 1\n- Cell (1,2) = 1\n- Cell (2,1) = 1\n- Cell (2,2) = 1\n\n##### Tank 2 (Top-right 2x2):\n- Clue for row 1 and row 2 is already satisfied by tank 1, so there’s no need to fill any cell here.\n- Clue for Column 3 and Column 4 requires only 2 cells to be filled in each column, and since none can be filled in the top part due to being already filled by tank 1, the bottom cells should be filled.\n\nThus:\n- Cell (3,3) = 1\n- Cell (3,4) = 1\n- Cell (4,3) = 1\n- Cell (4,4) = 1\n\n#### Step 3: Check all options against our analysis\n\nOption A:\n```\n1 1 0 0\n1 1 0 0\n0 0 1 1\n1 1 1 1\n```\n- Incorrect because Columns 3 and 4 are not fully filled up to the required water level.\n\nOption B:\n```\n0 1 0 0\n1 1 0 1\n1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1\n```\n- Incorrect because Row 1 does not have 2 filled cells as per clue.\n\nOption C:\n```\n1 1 0 0\n0 1 0 0\n1 1 0 1\n1 1 1 1\n```\n- Incorrect because Row 2 does not have 2 filled cells as per clue.\n\nOption D:\n```\n1 1 0 0\n1 1 0 0\n1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1\n```\n- Correct matches our analysis as:\n    - Rows 1 and 2 have 2 cells filled each.\n    - Rows 3 and 4 have 4 cells filled each.\n    - Columns 1 and 2 have 4 cells filled each.\n    - Columns 3 and 4 have 2 cells filled each.\n\nThus, the correct answer is:\n\n\\boxed{D}", "ground_truth": "D", "prompt": "You need to solve an Aquarium puzzle.\n\n**Aquarium Puzzle Rules:**\n1.  **The Grid:** The grid is divided into several regions called \"tanks\" by the thick colored (red) lines.\n2.  **The Goal:** Your goal is to fill some cells in the grid with \"water\".\n3.  **Water Levels:** Within each tank, water must settle at a uniform level.

Analyzing the Tanks and Clues:\n\n- There are four tanks separated by red lines.\n- We have row clues: 0, 0, 1, 4, 6, 6.\n- We have column clues: 2, 3, 3, 2, 3, 4.\n\n#### 2. Filling Cells Based on Clues:\n\n##### Row Analysis:\n- The first two rows have a clue of 0, so they should remain empty entirely.\n- The third row has a clue of 1. Since the only tank it can fill is the rightmost one, the last cell will be filled.\n- The fourth row has a clue of 4. The only way to satisfy this is to fill all cells in the middle tank (two cells) and the rightmost tank (two cells).\n- The fifth and sixth rows both have a clue of 6. This means they must be completely filled.\n\n##### Column Analysis:\n- Column 1 has a clue of 2. With the first two rows empty, the only way is to fill the 5th and 6th rows in this column.\n- Column 2 has a clue of 3. With the first two rows empty, the only way is to fill the 5th, 6th, and possibly part of 4th row.\n- Column 3 has a clue of 3. With the first two rows empty, the only way is to fill the 5th, 6th, and possibly part of 4th row.\n- Column 4 has a clue of 2. With the first two rows empty, the only way is to fill the 5th and 6th rows in this column.\n- Column 5 has a clue of 3. With the first two rows empty, the only way is to fill the 4th, 5th, and 6th rows in this column.\n- Column 6 has a clue of 4.

Check the fifth row: \\(1 + 5 + 9 + 8 + 1 + 2 = 26\\). This matches the clue.\n6. Check the sixth row: \\(4 + 5 + 7 + 7 + 2 + 9 = 34\\). This matches the clue.\n\nNow check columns:\n1. First column: \\(7 + 8 + 6 + 5 + 1 + 4 = 31\\). This matches the clue.\n2. Second column: \\(9 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 5 + 5 = 26\\). This does not match the clue (should be 29).\n\nSince Option A fails in one column, it is not the correct solution.\n\n#### Option B:\n```\n7 9 4 1 5 3\n8 4 2 6 3 1\n6 2 5 4 4 6\n5 1 1 3 8 5\n1 8 9 8 1 2\n4 5 7 7 2 9\n```\nSimilarly verify each row and column as above but notice:\nSecond column: \\(9 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 8 + 5 = 29\\).
