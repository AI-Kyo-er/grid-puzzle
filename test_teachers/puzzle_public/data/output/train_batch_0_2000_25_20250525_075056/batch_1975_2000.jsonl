It's located within a single-cell high tank, so the only possible way is:\n  \n```plaintext\n0 1 0 0\n```\n\n##### Row 3 Analysis:\n\n- Clue: `2` - Two cells need to be filled.

Therefore, we can fill two cells like this:\n  \n```plaintext\n1 1 0 0\n```\n\n##### Row 4 Analysis:\n\n- Clue: `2` - Two cells need to be filled. Since one cell is already filled due to the water level rule from row 3, only one more needs to be added:\n  \n```plaintext\n1 1 0 0\n```\n\n#### Checking Columns:\n\nNow, verify against column clues:\n\n- Column 1: Needs `2` water cells. We have `1` in row 3 and `1` in row 4 → satisfied.\n- Column 2: Needs `3` water cells. We have `1` in row 2, `1` in row 3, and `1` in row 4 → satisfied.\n- Column 3: Needs `0` water cells.

This cannot be true, need to adjust ensuring other rows and columns fit.\n\nFor Row 4:\n- No digits filled yet. We need three '0's and three '1's without breaking rules.\n\nFor Row 5:\n- One '0' and one '1' filled. Need two more '0's and two more '1's.\n\nFor Row 6:\n- One '1' filled.
