{"question_id": "aquarium_725", "response": "Let us solve the puzzle step by step according to the rules provided:\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n\n#### Step 1: Analyze the Clues\n- The top numbers represent the number of filled cells in each column.\n    - Column 0 has 0 filled cells.\n    - Column 1 has 0 filled cells.\n    - Column 2 has 1 filled cell.\n    - Column 3 has 4 filled cells.\n  \n- The left numbers represent the number of filled cells in each row.\n    - Row 0 has 1 filled cell.\n    - Rows 1 and 2 have 1 filled cell each.\n    - Row 3 has 2 filled cells.\n\n#### Step 2: Fill in the Cells According to the Clues and Tank Rules\n\n1. **Column 3**: Needs 4 filled cells. Since Column 3 spans 4 rows (forming one complete tank), all 4 cells in Column 3 must be filled.\n   - After filling these, the row clues get updated as follows:\n     - Row 0 now has 1 filled cell (satisfying its clue).\n     - Row 1 still needs 0 more filled cells.\n     - Row 2 still needs 0 more filled cells.\n     - Row 3 still needs 1 more filled cell.\n\n2. **Row 3**: Needs 2 filled cells. We already have 1 filled cell in Column 3, so we need 1 more filled cell in Row 3. The only unoccupied cell in this row is in Column 2.\n   - After filling this, the column clue gets updated as follows:\n     - Column 2 now has 1 filled cell (satisfying its clue).\n\n3. **Rows 1 and 2**: Each of these rows needs 1 filled cell. Since Columns 0 and 1 can't have any filled cells (as per their clues), the only possible cell to fill is in Column 2 for both rows. \n   - Filling these cells satisfies both Row 1 and Row 2 clues.\n\n#### Step 3: Verify the Solution\nNow let's verify if the final grid fits all clues:\n\n```\n0 0 0 1\n0 0 0 1\n0 0 0 1\n0 0 1 1\n```\n\n- **Columns**: \n  - Col 0: 0 filled cells → Matches.\n  - Col 1: 0 filled cells → Matches.\n  - Col 2: 1 filled cell → Matches.\n  - Col 3: 4 filled cells → Matches.\n- **Rows**:\n  - Row 0: 1 filled cell → Matches.\n  - Row 1: 1 filled cell → Matches.\n  - Row 2: 1 filled cell → Matches.\n  - Row 3: 2 filled cells → Matches.\n\nAll clues match perfectly, and water levels follow the rules within tanks.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{A}\n\\]", "ground_truth": "A", "prompt": "You need to solve an Aquarium puzzle.\n\n**Aquarium Puzzle Rules:**\n1.  **The Grid:** The grid is divided into several regions called \"tanks\" by the thick colored (red) lines.\n2.  **The Goal:** Your goal is to fill some cells in the grid with \"water\".\n3.  **Water Levels:** Within each tank, water must settle at a uniform level.
