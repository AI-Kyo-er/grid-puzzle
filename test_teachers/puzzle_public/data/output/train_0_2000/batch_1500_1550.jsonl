{"question_id": "binairo_480", "response": "Alright, so I've got this Binairo puzzle to solve, and I'm a bit new to these kinds of puzzles, but I'll try my best. Let me start by understanding the rules properly because that's crucial.\n\nFirst, each cell must be either 0 or 1. Got it. Second, no more than two identical numbers in a row or column. So, no three 0s or three 1s in a straight line. Third, each row and column must have an equal number of 0s and 1s. Since it's a 4x4 grid, that means each row and column should have exactly two 0s and two 1s. Fourth, no two rows can be identical, and same for columns. So, each row and column must be unique.\n\nOkay, now I need to check each option against these rules. Let's start with Option A:\n\nOption A:\n0 1 1 0  \n0 0 1 1  \n1 1 0 0  \n1 0 0 1  \n\nLet me go row by row. \n\nFirst row: 0,1,1,0. That's two 0s and two 1s. No three in a row, so that's good.\n\nSecond row: 0,0,1,1. Again, two of each, and no three in a row. Good.\n\nThird row: 1,1,0,0. Same here. No issues.\n\nFourth row: 1,0,0,1. Two of each, no three in a row. Good.\n\nNow columns. Let's check each column:\n\nFirst column: 0,0,1,1. Two 0s and two 1s. No three in a row. Good.\n\nSecond column: 1,0,1,0. That's alternating, so no consecutive duplicates. Two 1s and two 0s. Perfect.\n\nThird column: 1,1,0,0. Again, two each, and no three in a row. Good.\n\nFourth column: 0,1,0,1. Alternating, no issues. Two of each. Good.\n\nNow, checking for identical rows. First and second rows: 0,1,1,0 vs 0,0,1,1 – different. First and third: 0,1,1,0 vs 1,1,0,0 – different. First and fourth: 0,1,1,0 vs 1,0,0,1 – different. Second and third: 0,0,1,1 vs 1,1,0,0 – different (they are reverses, but not identical). Second and fourth: 0,0,1,1 vs 1,0,0,1 – different. Third and fourth: 1,1,0,0 vs 1,0,0,1 – different.\n\nColumns: Let's check if any are identical. First column: 0,0,1,1. Second:1,0,1,0. Third:1,1,0,0. Fourth:0,1,0,1. All columns are unique. So, Option A seems to satisfy all the rules.\n\nBut wait, let me check Option B just in case.\n\nOption B:\n1 1 1 0  \n0 0 1 1  \n1 1 0 0  \n1 0 0 1  \n\nFirst row: 1,1,1,0. Oh, wait! That's three 1s in a row. That's not allowed. So right away, Option B is invalid because it violates rule 2. So I can eliminate B.\n\nOption C:\n0 1 1 0  \n0 0 1 1  \n1 1 1 0  \n1 0 0 1  \n\nLet me check the third row: 1,1,1,0. That's three 1s in a row. So that's invalid as well. So C is out.\n\nOption D:\n0 1 1 0  \n0 0 1 1  \n1 1 0 0  \n1 0 0 0  \n\nLast row: 1,0,0,0. That's three 0s at the end. Violates rule 2. So D is invalid.\n\nSo, from this elimination, only Option A is valid. But just to make sure I didn't miss anything, let me double-check Option A.\n\nRows: All have two 0s and two 1s, no three in a row.\n\nColumns: All have two 0s and two 1s, no three in a row. Also, no identical rows or columns.\n\nWait, let me check the columns again more carefully.\n\nFirst column: 0,0,1,1 – two 0s, two 1s. No three in a row.\n\nSecond column: 1,0,1,0 – alternates, so no consecutive duplicates. Two 1s, two 0s.\n\nThird column: 1,1,0,0 – two each, no three in a row.\n\nFourth column: 0,1,0,1 – alternates, so good.\n\nRows: All four rows are different, as I checked before. Columns: All four columns are different.\n\nSo, yeah, Option A seems to satisfy all the rules. Therefore, the answer should be A.\n</think>\n\nThe correct answer is Option A, as it meets all the Binairo puzzle rules without any violations.\n\n\\boxed{A}", "ground_truth": "A", "prompt": "You need to solve a Binairo puzzle (Size: 4x4).You need to solve a Binairo puzzle.\n\n**Binairo Puzzle Rules:**\n1.

{"question_id": "binairo_275", "response": "Okay, so I've got this Binairo puzzle to solve, and I need to figure out which of the four options (A, B, C, D) is the correct one. Binairo puzzles are a bit tricky, but I remember the rules. Let me go through each rule and check the options one by one.\n\nFirst, the rules again:\n1. Each cell must be 0 or 1.\n2. No more than two consecutive identical numbers in any row or column. So, no three in a row, either horizontally or vertically.\n3. Each row and column must have an equal number of 0s and 1s. Since it's a 6x6 grid, each row and column should have exactly 3 zeros and 3 ones.\n4. No two rows or columns can be identical.\n\nAlright, let's check each option against these rules.\n\nStarting with Option A:\n\nOption A's grid:\n1 1 0 1 0 0\n0 1 0 0 1 1\n1 0 1 1 0 0\n0 1 0 1 1 0\n1 0 1 0 0 1\n0 0 1 0 1 1\n\nLet's check each row first for rule 2 and rule 3.\n\nRow 1: 1,1,0,1,0,0\n- Consecutive 1s at the start: two in a row, which is allowed. Then 0,1,0,0. Wait, the last two are 0,0. That's two consecutive 0s. So that's okay.\n- Count of 1s: 1,1,1,1 → four 1s. Wait, that's a problem because each row must have three 1s and three 0s. So row 1 in Option A has four 1s. That violates rule 3. So Option A is invalid.\n\nWait, let me recount. Row 1: positions 1,2,4 are 1s. So that's three 1s. Positions 3,5,6 are 0s. Hmm, actually, that's three 1s and three 0s. So maybe I miscounted.\n\nWait, 1,1,0,1,0,0: 1,1,0,1,0,0.\n\nSo the 1s are at positions 1,2,4: three 1s. 0s are at 3,5,6: three 0s. Okay, so that's fine. So no violation there.\n\nBut wait, looking at the consecutive 0s at the end: positions 5 and 6 are both 0. That's two in a row, which is allowed. So no problem.\n\nWait, I initially thought it had four 1s, but actually, it's three. So maybe I was wrong. Let me check again.\n\nRow 1: 1,1,0,1,0,0\n- 1s: 1,1,0,1 → that's four? No, positions 1,2,4: three 1s. 0s: positions 3,5,6: three 0s. So okay.\n\nSo no issue with row 1.\n\nRow 2: 0,1,0,0,1,1\n- 0,1,0,0,1,1\n- Consecutive 0s at positions 3,4: two in a row, allowed.\n- 1s at positions 2,5,6: three 1s. 0s at 1,3,4: three 0s. So okay.\n\nRow 3: 1,0,1,1,0,0\n- Consecutive 1s at positions 3,4: two in a row, okay.\n- 1s at 1,3,4: three. 0s at 2,5,6: three. Good.\n\nRow 4: 0,1,0,1,1,0\n- 0,1,0,1,1,0\n- 1s at 2,4,5: three. 0s at 1,3,6: three. Good.\n- Consecutive 1s at 4,5: two, okay.\n\nRow 5: 1,0,1,0,0,1\n- 1,0,1,0,0,1\n- 1s at 1,3,6: three. 0s at 2,4,5: three. Good.\n- Consecutive 0s at 4,5: two, okay.\n\nRow 6: 0,0,1,0,1,1\n- 0,0: two in a row, okay.\n- 1s at 3,5,6: three. 0s at 1,2,4: three. Good.\n\nSo all rows in Option A satisfy rules 2 and 3.\n\nNow, check columns for rule 2 and 3.\n\nColumn 1:\n1,0,1,0,1,0\n- Alternating, no two in a row. Good.\n- Count: three 1s (positions 1,3,5) and three 0s (2,4,6). Good.\n\nColumn 2:\n1,1,0,1,0,0\n- 1,1 at the start: two in a row, okay.\n- 1s: positions 1,2,4: three. 0s: 3,5,6: three. Good.\n\nColumn 3:\n0,0,1,0,1,1\n- 0,0 at start: two in a row, okay.\n- 0s: 1,2,4: three. 1s: 3,5,6: three. Good.\n\nColumn 4:\n1,0,1,1,0,0\n- 1,0,1,1: two 1s in a row at positions 3,4, okay.\n- 1s: 1,3,4: three. 0s: 2,5,6: three. Good.\n\nColumn 5:\n0,1,0,1,0,1\n- Alternating, no consecutive same. Good.\n- 1s: positions 2,4,6: three. 0s: 1,3,5: three. Good.\n\nColumn 6:\n0,1,0,0,1,1\n- 0,1,0,0: two 0s at positions 3,4, okay.\n- 1s: 2,5,6: three. 0s: 1,3,4: three. Good.\n\nSo columns in Option A also satisfy rules 2 and 3.\n\nNow, check rule 4: no two identical rows or columns.\n\nLooking at the rows:\n\nRow 1: 1,1,0,1,0,0\nRow 2: 0,1,0,0,1,1\nRow 3: 1,0,1,1,0,0\nRow 4: 0,1,0,1,1,0\nRow 5: 1,0,1,0,0,1\nRow 6: 0,0,1,0,1,1\n\nAre any rows identical? Let's compare each pair.\n\nRow 1 vs Row 2: Different.\nRow 1 vs Row 3: Different.\nRow 1 vs Row 4: Different.\nRow 1 vs Row 5: Different.\nRow 1 vs Row 6: Different.\n\nRow 2 vs Row 3: Different.\nRow 2 vs Row 4: Different.\nRow 2 vs Row 5: Different.\nRow 2 vs Row 6: Different.\n\nRow 3 vs Row 4: Different.\nRow 3 vs Row 5: Different.\nRow 3 vs Row 6: Different.\n\nRow 4 vs Row 5: Different.\nRow 4 vs Row 6: Different.\n\nRow 5 vs Row 6: Different.\n\nSo no duplicate rows.\n\nNow, columns:\n\nColumn 1: 1,0,1,0,1,0\nColumn 2:1,1,0,1,0,0\nColumn 3:0,0,1,0,1,1\nColumn 4:1,0,1,1,0,0\nColumn 5:0,1,0,1,0,1\nColumn 6:0,1,0,0,1,1\n\nCheck for duplicates:\n\nColumn 1 vs others: all different.\nColumn 2 vs others: unique.\nColumn 3 vs others: unique.\nColumn 4 vs others: unique.\nColumn 5 vs others: unique.\nColumn 6 vs others: unique.\n\nSo, all rows and columns are unique. So Option A satisfies all rules.\n\nHmm, but wait, let's check Option B to see if it's also valid, because sometimes there can be multiple correct options, but the problem says there must be one right answer.\n\nOption B's grid:\n0 1 0 1 0 0\n0 1 0 0 1 1\n1 0 1 1 0 0\n0 1 0 1 1 0\n1 0 1 0 0 1\n0 0 1 0 1 1\n\nLet's check rows for rule 3.\n\nRow 1: 0,1,0,1,0,0\n- 0s: positions 1,3,5,6 → four 0s. 1s: positions 2,4 → two 1s. So that's four 0s and two 1s. That violates rule 3, which requires equal numbers. So Option B is invalid.\n\nWait, but let me recount.\n\nRow 1: 0,1,0,1,0,0 → 0s at 1,3,5,6: four 0s. 1s at 2,4: two. So yes, that's four and two. So Option B is invalid.\n\nSo Option B is out.\n\nOption C's grid:\n1 1 0 1 0 0\n0 1 0 0 1 1\n1 0 1 1 0 0\n0 1 0 0 1 0\n1 0 1 0 0 1\n0 0 1 0 1 1\n\nLet's check rows first.\n\nRow 1: same as Option A: three 1s and three 0s, no more than two consecutive. So okay.\n\nRow 2: same as Option A: okay.\n\nRow 3: same as Option A: okay.\n\nRow 4: 0,1,0,0,1,0\n- 0s at positions 1,3,4,6: four 0s. 1s at 2,5: two 1s. So that's four 0s and two 1s. That violates rule 3. So Option C is invalid.\n\nWait, let me recount Row 4: 0,1,0,0,1,0.\n\n0s: positions 1,3,4,6: four. 1s: 2,5: two. So yes, four 0s. So Option C is invalid.\n\nOption D's grid:\n1 1 0 1 0 0\n0 1 0 0 1 1\n1 0 1 1 0 0\n0 1 0 1 1 0\n1 0 1 0 0 1\n0 0 1 0 1 0\n\nCheck rows first.\n\nRow 1: same as Option A: okay.\n\nRow 2: same as Option A: okay.\n\nRow 3: same as Option A: okay.\n\nRow 4: 0,1,0,1,1,0\n- 0s: positions 1,3,6: three. 1s: 2,4,5: three. Okay.\n- Consecutive 1s at 4,5: two, okay.\n\nRow 5: same as Option A: okay.\n\nRow 6: 0,0,1,0,1,0\n- 0s: positions 1,2,4,6: four. 1s: 3,5: two. So that's four 0s and two 1s. That violates rule 3. So Option D is invalid.\n\nWait, let me recount Row 6: 0,0,1,0,1,0.\n\n0s: 1,2,4,6: four. 1s: 3,5: two. So yes, four 0s. So Option D is invalid.\n\nSo only Option A is valid so far.\n\nBut wait, I thought I found that Option A is valid, but I need to check all rules again because sometimes columns might have issues.\n\nWait, earlier I checked the columns for Option A and they all had three 0s and three 1s, with no more than two consecutive. So columns are okay.\n\nBut let's double-check the columns again.\n\nColumn 1: 1,0,1,0,1,0 → three 1s, three 0s. No consecutive same. Good.\n\nColumn 2:1,1,0,1,0,0 → three 1s, three 0s. Consecutive 1s at start: two, allowed. Consecutive 0s at end: two, allowed. Good.\n\nColumn 3:0,0,1,0,1,1 → three 0s, three 1s. Consecutive 0s at start: two, allowed. Consecutive 1s at end: two, allowed. Good.\n\nColumn 4:1,0,1,1,0,0 → three 1s, three 0s. Consecutive 1s: two, allowed. Consecutive 0s: two, allowed. Good.\n\nColumn 5:0,1,0,1,0,1 → three 0s, three 1s. Alternating, so no consecutive same. Good.\n\nColumn 6:0,1,0,0,1,1 → three 0s, three 1s. Consecutive 0s: two, allowed. Consecutive 1s: two, allowed. Good.\n\nSo all columns are okay.\n\nAlso, as checked earlier, all rows and columns are unique.\n\nTherefore, Option A is the correct solution.\n</think>\n\nThe correct answer is Option A as it satisfies all the given rules of the Binairo puzzle.\n\n\\boxed{A}", "ground_truth": "A", "prompt": "You need to solve a Binairo puzzle (Size: 6x6).You need to solve a Binairo puzzle.\n\n**Binairo Puzzle Rules:**\n1.

{"question_id": "binairo_1170", "response": "Alright, so I've got this Binairo puzzle to solve, and there are four options to consider: A, B, C, and D. The grid is 6x6, which is a standard size for Binairo puzzles. I need to figure out which one of these options correctly solves the puzzle based on the given rules.\n\nFirst, let me recap the rules to make sure I understand them:\n\n1. Each cell must be either 0 or 1.\n2. No more than two consecutive identical numbers in any row or column. So, sequences like 000 or 111 are forbidden.\n3. Each row and column must have an equal number of 0s and 1s. Since it's a 6x6 grid, each row and column should have exactly three 0s and three 1s.\n4. No two rows can be identical, and no two columns can be identical either.\n\nNow, I'll go through each option one by one, checking these rules. Let's start with Option A.\n\n**Option A:**\n\nHere's the grid as given:\n\n0 1 1 0 0 1  \n0 0 1 0 1 1  \n1 1 0 1 0 0  \n1 0 1 0 1 0  \n0 1 0 1 0 1  \n1 0 0 1 1 0\n\nLet me check each rule for this option.\n\n**Rule 1:** All cells are either 0 or 1. That's satisfied here.\n\n**Rule 2:** No more than two consecutive identical numbers in any row or column.\n\nLet's check each row:\n\nRow 1: 0 1 1 0 0 1  \n- Consecutive 1s: positions 2-3 (two in a row) – that's allowed.\n- Consecutive 0s: positions 4-5 (two in a row) – also allowed.\nNo three in a row, so this row is okay.\n\nRow 2: 0 0 1 0 1 1  \n- Consecutive 0s: positions 1-2 (two) – okay.\n- Consecutive 1s: positions 5-6 (two) – okay.\nNo three, so this is fine.\n\nRow 3: 1 1 0 1 0 0  \n- Consecutive 1s: positions 1-2 (two) – okay.\n- Consecutive 0s: positions 5-6 (two) – okay.\nGood.\n\nRow 4: 1 0 1 0 1 0  \n- Alternates perfectly, no two in a row. So, no issues here.\n\nRow 5: 0 1 0 1 0 1  \n- Same as row 4, alternates perfectly. No consecutive duplicates.\n\nRow 6: 1 0 0 1 1 0  \n- Consecutive 0s: positions 2-3 (two) – okay.\n- Consecutive 1s: positions 4-5 (two) – okay.\nNo three, so fine.\n\nNow, checking columns:\n\nLet's go column by column.\n\nColumn 1:\n0  \n0  \n1  \n1  \n0  \n1  \nLooking at this, we have 0,0 which is two in a row – allowed.\n1,1 at positions 3-4 – two in a row, allowed.\nThen 0,1 – no consecutive duplicates. So, okay.\n\nColumn 2:\n1  \n0  \n1  \n0  \n1  \n0  \nAlternates perfectly. No consecutive duplicates. Good.\n\nColumn 3:\n1  \n1  \n0  \n1  \n0  \n0  \nConsecutive 1s at positions 1-2 (two) – okay.\nThen 0,1,0,0 – two 0s at the end (positions 5-6). Wait, in the column, the last two are 0 and 0. So, two in a row, which is allowed. So, no problem here.\n\nWait, no. Wait, in the column 3, the last two entries are 0 and 0? Let me check again:\n\nColumn 3 entries: 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0.\n\nSo, positions 5 and 6 are both 0. That's two in a row, which is allowed. So, no issues.\n\nColumn 4:\n0  \n0  \n1  \n0  \n1  \n1  \nLooking at this, positions 1-2 are 0,0 – allowed.\nThen 1,0,1,1 – consecutive 1s at positions 4-5-6? Wait, positions 4 is 0, position 5 is 1, position 6 is 1. So, only two 1s at the end. So, that's allowed. So, column 4 is okay.\n\nColumn 5:\n0  \n1  \n0  \n1  \n0  \n1  \nAlternates, so no consecutive duplicates. Good.\n\nColumn 6:\n1  \n1  \n0  \n0  \n1  \n0  \nPositions 1-2: 1,1 – allowed.\nPositions 3-4: 0,0 – allowed.\nThen 1,0 – no duplicates. So, okay.\n\nSo, Rule 2 is satisfied for all rows and columns in Option A.\n\n**Rule 3:** Each row and column must have three 0s and three 1s.\n\nLet's check each row:\n\nRow 1: 0,1,1,0,0,1 → Count: 3 zeros, 3 ones. Good.\n\nRow 2: 0,0,1,0,1,1 → 3 zeros, 3 ones. Good.\n\nRow 3: 1,1,0,1,0,0 → 3 zeros, 3 ones. Good.\n\nRow 4: 1,0,1,0,1,0 → 3 zeros, 3 ones. Good.\n\nRow 5: 0,1,0,1,0,1 → 3 zeros, 3 ones. Good.\n\nRow 6: 1,0,0,1,1,0 → Count: Let's see, 1,0,0,1,1,0 → zeros at positions 2,3,6: three zeros. Ones at 1,4,5: three ones. So, good.\n\nNow, columns:\n\nColumn 1: 0,0,1,1,0,1 → 3 zeros, 3 ones. Good.\n\nColumn 2: 1,0,1,0,1,0 → 3 zeros, 3 ones. Good.\n\nColumn 3: 1,1,0,1,0,0 → 3 zeros, 3 ones. Good.\n\nColumn 4: 0,0,1,0,1,1 → 3 zeros, 3 ones. Good.\n\nColumn 5: 0,1,0,1,0,1 → 3 zeros, 3 ones. Good.\n\nColumn 6: 1,1,0,0,1,0 → 3 zeros, 3 ones. Good.\n\nSo, Rule 3 is satisfied for all rows and columns in Option A.\n\n**Rule 4:** No two rows can be identical, and no two columns can be identical.\n\nLet's check the rows:\n\nRow 1: 0 1 1 0 0 1  \nRow 2: 0 0 1 0 1 1  \nRow 3: 1 1 0 1 0 0  \nRow 4: 1 0 1 0 1 0  \nRow 5: 0 1 0 1 0 1  \nRow 6: 1 0 0 1 1 0  \n\nLooking for duplicates:\n\nCompare Row 1 with others: unique.\nRow 2: unique.\nRow 3: unique.\nRow 4: unique.\nRow 5: unique.\nRow 6: unique.\nSo, all rows are different. Good.\n\nNow, columns:\n\nColumn 1: 0,0,1,1,0,1  \nColumn 2: 1,0,1,0,1,0  \nColumn 3: 1,1,0,1,0,0  \nColumn 4: 0,0,1,0,1,1  \nColumn 5: 0,1,0,1,0,1  \nColumn 6: 1,1,0,0,1,0  \n\nCheck for duplicates among columns.\n\nCompare Column 1 and Column 4: Column 1 is [0,0,1,1,0,1], Column 4 is [0,0,1,0,1,1]. They are different.\n\nColumn 2: [1,0,1,0,1,0], unique.\n\nColumn 3: [1,1,0,1,0,0], unique.\n\nColumn 5: [0,1,0,1,0,1], unique.\n\nColumn 6: [1,1,0,0,1,0], unique.\n\nSo, all columns are unique as well. So, Rule 4 is satisfied.\n\nSo, Option A seems to satisfy all the rules.

Good.\n\n**Rule 2:** No more than two consecutive identical numbers.\n\nCheck rows:\n\nRow 1: 1 1 1 0 0 1  \n- Three 1s at the start (positions 1-3). That's three in a row. Which is not allowed. So, this row violates Rule 2.\n\nSo, Option B is invalid. No need to check further.\n\n**Option C:**\n\nGrid:\n\n0 1 1 0 0 1  \n0 0 1 0 1 1  \n1 1 0 1 0 0  \n1 0 1 1 1 0  \n0 1 0 1 0 1  \n1 0 0 1 1 0  \n\nCheck Rule 2 for this option.\n\nCheck rows first.\n\nRow 1: 0 1 1 0 0 1  \n- No three in a row. Okay.\n\nRow 2: 0 0 1 0 1 1  \n- Two 0s at start, two 1s at end. Okay.\n\nRow 3: 1 1 0 1 0 0  \n- Two 1s, two 0s. Okay.\n\nRow 4: 1 0 1 1 1 0  \n- Let's see: positions 3-5 are 1,1,1. That's three 1s in a row. So, violates Rule 2.\n\nSo, Option C is invalid.\n\n**Option D:**\n\nGrid:\n\n0 1 1 0 0 1  \n0 0 1 0 1 1  \n1 1 0 1 0 0  \n1 0 1 0 1 0  \n0 1 0 1 0 1  \n1 0 0 1 1 1  \n\nCheck this one.\n\n**Rule 2:** Check for three in a row.\n\nRows:\n\nRow 1: 0 1 1 0 0 1 – okay.\n\nRow 2: 0 0 1 0 1 1 – okay.\n\nRow 3: 1 1 0 1 0 0 – okay.\n\nRow 4: 1 0 1 0 1 0 – okay.\n\nRow 5: 0 1 0 1 0 1 – okay.\n\nRow 6: 1 0 0 1 1 1  \n- Let's see: positions 5-6 are 1,1 – two. But wait, position 4 is 1, so positions 4-5-6 are 1,1,1. That's three in a row. So, violates Rule 2.\n\nThus, Option D is invalid.\n\nSo, after checking all options, only Option A satisfies all the rules without any violations.

{"question_id": "binairo_214", "response": "Alright, so I need to solve this Binairo puzzle, and there are four options to choose from: A, B, C, or D. Let me first recall the rules to make sure I don't miss anything.\n\n1. Each cell must be either 0 or 1. That's straightforward.\n2. No more than two consecutive identical numbers in any row or column. So, sequences like 000 or 111 are not allowed.\n3. Each row and column must have an equal number of 0s and 1s. Since it's a 4x4 grid, each row and column should have exactly two 0s and two 1s.\n4. No two rows can be identical, and no two columns can be identical either.\n\nOkay, so I'll go through each option one by one and check these rules.\n\nStarting with Option A:\n\nOption A:\n1 1 0 0\n1 0 1 0\n0 0 1 1\n0 1 0 1\n\nLet me check each row first.\n\nRow 1: 1,1,0,0\n- Are there more than two same numbers in a row? Yes, the first two are 1s, which is allowed since it's exactly two. The last two are 0s, also exactly two. So that's okay.\n- Number of 0s and 1s: two 1s and two 0s. Good.\n\nRow 2: 1,0,1,0\n- Alternating, so no more than two same numbers consecutively. Perfect.\n- Count: two 1s, two 0s. Good.\n\nRow 3: 0,0,1,1\n- Same as Row 1, two 0s followed by two 1s. Allowed.\n- Count: two each. Good.\n\nRow 4: 0,1,0,1\n- Alternating, so no issue.\n- Count: two each.\n\nNow, checking columns.\n\nColumn 1:\n1,1,0,0\n- Same as Row 1, so two 1s followed by two 0s. No problem.\n- Count: two 1s, two 0s.\n\nColumn 2:\n1,0,0,1\n- Let's see: 1,0,0,1. There's a 00 in the middle. That's two consecutive 0s, which is allowed. So no problem.\n- Count: two 1s, two 0s.\n\nColumn 3:\n0,1,1,0\n- 0,1,1,0. There's 11 in the middle. Allowed.\n- Count: two 0s, two 1s.\n\nColumn 4:\n0,0,1,1\n- Same as Row 1, two 0s followed by two 1s. Allowed.\n- Count: two each.\n\nNow, checking if any two rows are identical. Let's see:\n\nRow 1: 1100\nRow 2: 1010\nRow 3: 0011\nRow 4: 0101\n\nAll rows are unique. Good.\n\nColumns:\n\nColumn 1: 1100\nColumn 2: 1001\nColumn 3: 0110\nColumn 4: 0011\n\nWait, Column 4 is 0011, which is same as Row 1. But the rule is that no two columns can be identical. Let me check if any columns are duplicates.\n\nLooking at the columns:\n\nColumn 1: 1,1,0,0\nColumn 2: 1,0,0,1\nColumn 3: 0,1,1,0\nColumn 4: 0,0,1,1\n\nAre any of these the same? Let's see:\n\nColumn 1 is different from the others. Column 2 is unique. Column 3 is unique. Column 4 is 0011, which is same as Row 1. But wait, the rule is that no two columns can be identical. So if two columns are the same, that's a problem.\n\nLooking at Column 1 and Column 4: Column 1 is 1100, Column 4 is 0011. They are reverses, but not identical. So okay.\n\nWait, no, in the columns, are any two the same? Let me list them:\n\nColumn 1: 1,1,0,0\nColumn 2: 1,0,0,1\nColumn 3: 0,1,1,0\nColumn 4: 0,0,1,1\n\nNone of these columns are identical to each other. So that's good.\n\nSo, Option A seems to satisfy all the rules.\n\nBut wait, before I conclude, let me check the other options to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nOption B:\n\n0 1 0 0\n1 0 1 0\n0 0 1 1\n0 1 0 1\n\nLet me check rows first.\n\nRow 1: 0,1,0,0\n- Consecutive 0s at the end: two, which is allowed.\n- Count: two 0s, two 1s.\n\nRow 2: 1,0,1,0\n- Alternating, so no issues.\n\nRow 3: 0,0,1,1\n- Two 0s, then two 1s. Allowed.\n\nRow 4: 0,1,0,1\n- Alternating.\n\nSo rows seem okay.\n\nNow, columns.\n\nColumn 1: 0,1,0,0\n- Let's see: 0,1,0,0. Consecutive 0s at the end. Allowed.\n- Count: three 0s and one 1. Wait, that's a problem. Each column must have two 0s and two 1s. So Column 1 has three 0s, which violates rule 3. So Option B is invalid.\n\nOkay, so B is out.\n\nOption C:\n\n1 1 0 0\n1 0 1 0\n0 0 0 1\n0 1 0 1\n\nChecking rows.\n\nRow 1: 1,1,0,0. Good.\n\nRow 2: 1,0,1,0. Good.\n\nRow 3: 0,0,0,1. Oh no, three 0s in a row. That violates rule 2 because you can't have three consecutive same numbers. So Row 3 is invalid. Therefore, Option C is out.\n\nOption D:\n\n1 1 0 0\n1 0 1 0\n0 0 1 1\n0 1 0 0\n\nChecking rows.\n\nRow 1: 1,1,0,0. Good.\n\nRow 2: 1,0,1,0. Good.\n\nRow 3: 0,0,1,1. Good.\n\nRow 4: 0,1,0,0. Let's see: ends with two 0s, which is allowed. But count: two 0s and two 1s. Wait, Row 4: 0,1,0,0. So that's three 0s? Wait, no: 0,1,0,0 has three 0s? Wait, 0,1,0,0: first is 0, second is 1, third is 0, fourth is 0. So that's three 0s. So count: three 0s and one 1. Which violates rule 3. So Row 4 is invalid, making Option D invalid.\n\nSo, only Option A satisfies all the rules.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check Option A's columns again to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nColumn 1: 1,1,0,0\n- No more than two same in a row. Good.\n- Count: two 1s, two 0s.\n\nColumn 2: 1,0,0,1\n- Consecutive 0s: two, allowed.\n- Count: two 1s, two 0s.\n\nColumn 3: 0,1,1,0\n- Consecutive 1s: two, allowed.\n- Count: two 0s, two 1s.\n\nColumn 4: 0,0,1,1\n- Consecutive 0s and 1s: two each.\n- Count: two 0s, two 1s.\n\nSo all columns are good.\n\nAlso, checking for duplicate rows:\n\nRow 1: 1100\nRow 2: 1010\nRow 3: 0011\nRow 4: 0101\n\nAll unique.\n\nColumns:\n\nColumn 1: 1100\nColumn 2: 1001\nColumn 3: 0110\nColumn 4: 0011\n\nAll unique.\n\nTherefore, Option A is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe correct answer is Option A, as it adheres to all the given rules without any violations.\n\n\\boxed{A}", "ground_truth": "A", "prompt": "You need to solve a Binairo puzzle (Size: 4x4).You need to solve a Binairo puzzle.\n\n**Binairo Puzzle Rules:**\n1.

Each cell must be 0 or 1. That's straightforward.\n2. No more than two consecutive identical numbers in any row or column. So, no three 0s or 1s in a row.\n3.

No two rows can be identical, and no two columns can be identical.\n\nLooking at the options, A, B, C, D are given. I need to check each one against these rules.\n\nLet's start with Option A:\n\nOption A:\n0 0 1 1\n1 1 0 0\n0 1 1 0\n1 0 0 1\n\nLet me check each row first for consecutive numbers.\n\nRow 1: 0 0 1 1. So, two 0s followed by two 1s. No three in a row, so that's okay.\n\nRow 2: 1 1 0 0. Similarly, two 1s then two 0s. Okay.\n\nRow 3: 0 1 1 0. Here, there are two 1s in the middle, which is okay, but then it alternates. No three in a row.\n\nRow 4: 1 0 0 1. Two 0s in the middle. So, that's okay too.\n\nNow, check columns for consecutive numbers.\n\nColumn 1: 0, 1, 0, 1. Alternates, so no problem.\n\nColumn 2: 0, 1, 1, 0. Here, the third and fourth rows are 1 and 0, but wait, column 2 is 0,1,1,0. So there are two 1s in a row, which is allowed. So that's fine.\n\nWait, no. The rule says no more than two consecutive. So two is okay, but three is not. So two is allowed.\n\nWait, no, actually, the rule says no more than two. So two is allowed, but three or more is not. So two consecutive is acceptable.\n\nSo column 2 has two 1s in a row, which is okay.\n\nColumn 3: 1,0,1,0. Alternates, so no problem.\n\nColumn 4: 1,0,0,1. Here, two 0s in the middle. So that's two in a row, which is allowed.\n\nSo all rows and columns pass the consecutive rule.\n\nNow, check each row and column has two 0s and two 1s.\n\nRow 1: 0,0,1,1 → two 0s, two 1s. Good.\n\nRow 2: 1,1,0,0 → same. Good.\n\nRow 3: 0,1,1,0 → two 0s, two 1s. Good.\n\nRow 4: 1,0,0,1 → two 0s, two 1s.

Good.\n\nNow, check counts.\n\nEach row has two 0s and two 1s? Let's see.\n\nRow 1: 1,0,1,1 → three 1s and one 0. Wait, that's three 1s. So that's a problem because each row needs exactly two 0s and two 1s. So Option B is invalid because row 1 has three 1s and only one 0. So Option B is out.\n\nSo I can eliminate Option B.\n\nOption C:\n\n0 0 1 1\n\n1 1 0 0\n\n0 1 0 0\n\n1 0 0 1\n\nLet's check rows.\n\nRow 1: 0011 → two 0s, two 1s. Good.\n\nRow 2: 1100 → same. Good.\n\nRow 3: 0100 → two 0s, two 1s? Wait, 0,1,0,0: that's three 0s and one 1. So that's bad. So row 3 has three 0s and one 1, which violates rule 3.

Good.\n\nNext, check if each row and column has exactly two 0s and two 1s.\n\nFor each row in Option A:\n\nRow 1: 2 zeros, 2 ones. Good.\n\nRow 2: 2 zeros, 2 ones. Good.\n\nRow 3: 2 zeros, 2 ones. Good.\n\nRow 4: 2 zeros, 2 ones. Good.\n\nNow columns:\n\nColumn 1: 2 zeros, 2 ones. Good.\n\nColumn 2: 2 zeros, 2 ones. Good.\n\nColumn 3: 2 zeros, 2 ones. Good.\n\nColumn 4: 2 zeros, 2 ones. Good.\n\nNext, check if any rows are identical. Looking at the rows:\n\nRow 1: 0 0 1 1\n\nRow 2: 0 1 1 0\n\nRow 3: 1 1 0 0\n\nRow 4: 1 0 0 1\n\nAll rows are different.\n\nColumns:\n\nColumn 1: 0,0,1,1\n\nColumn 2: 0,1,1,0\n\nColumn 3: 1,1,0,0\n\nColumn 4: 1,0,0,1\n\nAll columns are different.\n\nSo, Option A seems to satisfy all the rules. Let me check the other options just to be sure.\n\nOption B:\n\n1 0 1 1\n\n0 1 1 0\n\n1 1 0 0\n\n1 0 0 1\n\nFirst, check the rows.\n\nRow 1: 1 0 1 1. There are two 1s at the end. That's allowed.\n\nRow 2: 0 1 1 0. Two 1s in the middle, fine.\n\nRow 3: 1 1 0 0. Two 1s followed by two 0s. Good.\n\nRow 4: 1 0 0 1. Two 0s in the middle. Okay.\n\nColumns:\n\nColumn 1: 1,0,1,1. Let's see: 1,0,1,1. So, we have two 1s at the end. No three in a row. Good.\n\nColumn 2: 0,1,1,0. Two 1s in the middle. Fine.\n\nColumn 3: 1,1,0,0. Two 1s followed by two 0s. Good.\n\nColumn 4: 1,0,0,1. Two 0s in the middle. Good.\n\nNow, count 0s and 1s in each row and column.\n\nEach row in B:\n\nRow 1: 2 ones, 2 zeros? 1,0,1,1: that's three 1s and one 0. Oh wait, that's three 1s. Which violates the rule because each row must have exactly two 0s and two 1s. So, Option B is invalid.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Row 1: 1,0,1,1. So, three 1s and one 0. That's not allowed. So, Option B is out.\n\nOption C:\n\n0 0 1 1\n\n0 1 1 0\n\n1 1 1 0\n\n1 0 0 1\n\nCheck the rows first.\n\nRow 1: 0,0,1,1: okay.\n\nRow 2: 0,1,1,0: okay.\n\nRow 3: 1,1,1,0: Oh no, three 1s in a row. That's invalid. So, Option C is out.\n\nOption D:\n\n0 0 1 1\n\n0 1 1 0\n\n1 1 0 0\n\n1 0 0 0\n\nCheck rows:\n\nRow 1: 0,0,1,1: okay.\n\nRow 2: 0,1,1,0: okay.\n\nRow 3: 1,1,0,0: okay.\n\nRow 4: 1,0,0,0: Here, three 0s at the end.

{"question_id": "binairo_752", "response": "Alright, so I've got this Binairo puzzle to solve, and there are four options to choose from: A, B, C, and D. I need to figure out which one is the correct solution based on the given rules. Let me go through each rule one by one and check the options.\n\nFirst, let me recall the rules to make sure I don't miss anything:\n\n1. Each cell must be 0 or 1. Okay, so all options are using 0s and 1s, so that's fine.\n2. No more than two consecutive identical numbers in any row or column. So I need to check for any rows or columns that have three in a row.\n3. Each row and column must have an equal number of 0s and 1s. Since it's a 6x6 grid, each row and column should have exactly three 0s and three 1s.\n4. No two rows can be identical, and no two columns can be identical. So I need to make sure all rows are unique and all columns are unique.\n\nLet me start by checking each option against these rules.\n\n**Option A:**\n```\n0 1 1 0 1 0\n0 0 1 0 1 1\n1 1 0 1 0 0\n1 0 1 0 0 1\n0 1 0 1 1 0\n1 0 0 1 0 1\n```\n\nLet's check each rule.\n\nRule 2: Check for consecutive 0s or 1s.\n\nRow 1: 0 1 1 0 1 0 → There's a '1 1' which is two consecutive, that's allowed. No three in a row. Okay.\n\nRow 2: 0 0 1 0 1 1 → '0 0' is okay, but '1 1' at the end is two, so that's fine.\n\nRow 3: 1 1 0 1 0 0 → '1 1' is okay, '0 0' at the end is okay.\n\nRow 4: 1 0 1 0 0 1 → No more than two consecutive. Good.\n\nRow 5: 0 1 0 1 1 0 → '1 1' is okay.\n\nRow 6: 1 0 0 1 0 1 → '0 0' is okay.\n\nColumns:\n\nColumn 1: 0,0,1,1,0,1 → No three in a row.\n\nColumn 2:1,0,1,0,1,0 → Alternating, so no issues.\n\nColumn 3:1,1,0,1,0,0 → '1,1' is okay.\n\nColumn 4:0,0,1,0,1,1 → '0,0' and '1,1' at the end.\n\nColumn 5:1,1,0,0,1,0 → '1,1' and '0,0' are okay.\n\nColumn 6:0,1,0,1,0,1 → Alternating, no issues.\n\nSo Rule 2 is satisfied for all rows and columns.\n\nRule 3: Each row and column must have three 0s and three 1s.\n\nLet's count for each row:\n\nRow 1: 0,1,1,0,1,0 → 3 zeros and 3 ones. Good.\n\nRow 2: 0,0,1,0,1,1 → 3 zeros and 3 ones. Good.\n\nRow 3:1,1,0,1,0,0 → 3 zeros and 3 ones. Good.\n\nRow 4:1,0,1,0,0,1 → 3 zeros and 3 ones. Good.\n\nRow 5:0,1,0,1,1,0 → 3 zeros and 3 ones. Good.\n\nRow 6:1,0,0,1,0,1 → 3 zeros and 3 ones. Good.\n\nNow columns:\n\nColumn 1: 0,0,1,1,0,1 → 3 zeros and 3 ones. Good.\n\nColumn 2:1,0,1,0,1,0 → 3 each. Good.\n\nColumn 3:1,1,0,1,0,0 → 3 zeros and 3 ones.\n\nColumn 4:0,0,1,0,1,1 → 3 zeros and 3 ones.\n\nColumn 5:1,1,0,0,1,0 → 3 zeros and 3 ones.\n\nColumn 6:0,1,0,1,0,1 → 3 each. Good.\n\nSo Rule 3 is satisfied.\n\nRule 4: No two rows can be identical, and no two columns can be identical.\n\nLooking at the rows:\n\nRow 1: 0 1 1 0 1 0\n\nRow 2: 0 0 1 0 1 1\n\nRow 3:1 1 0 1 0 0\n\nRow 4:1 0 1 0 0 1\n\nRow 5:0 1 0 1 1 0\n\nRow 6:1 0 0 1 0 1\n\nAll rows look unique. I'll double-check:\n\n- Row 1 vs others: unique.\n- Row 2: unique.\n- Row 3: unique.\n- Row 4: unique.\n- Row 5: unique.\n- Row 6: unique.\n\nNow columns:\n\nLooking at the columns as sequences:\n\nColumn 1: 0,0,1,1,0,1\n\nColumn 2:1,0,1,0,1,0\n\nColumn 3:1,1,0,1,0,0\n\nColumn 4:0,0,1,0,1,1\n\nColumn 5:1,1,0,0,1,0\n\nColumn 6:0,1,0,1,0,1\n\nAre any of these columns identical? Let me see:\n\n- Column 1: 0,0,1,1,0,1\n\n- Column 2:1,0,1,0,1,0 → Different.\n\n- Column 3:1,1,0,1,0,0 → Different.\n\n- Column 4:0,0,1,0,1,1 → Different from Column 1? Yes.\n\n- Column 5:1,1,0,0,1,0 → Different.\n\n- Column 6:0,1,0,1,0,1 → Different.\n\nSo all columns are unique.\n\nThus, Option A satisfies all rules. Hmm, but let me check the other options just to be sure because sometimes more than one can satisfy, but in this case, I need to find which one is correct.\n\n**Option B:**\n```\n1 1 1 0 1 0\n0 0 1 0 1 1\n1 1 0 1 0 0\n1 0 1 0 0 1\n0 1 0 1 1 0\n1 0 0 1 0 1\n```\n\nRule 2: Check for more than two consecutive.\n\nLooking at Row 1:1 1 1 0 1 0 → Oh, there are three 1s at the start. That's not allowed. So Option B is invalid.\n\nSo I can eliminate Option B.\n\n**Option C:**\n```\n0 1 1 0 1 0\n0 0 1 0 1 1\n1 1 0 1 0 0\n1 0 1 1 0 1\n0 1 0 1 1 0\n1 0 0 1 0 1\n```\n\nRule 2: Check for three in a row.\n\nRow 1:0 1 1 0 1 0 → No problem.\n\nRow 2:0 0 1 0 1 1 → No problem.\n\nRow 3:1 1 0 1 0 0 → No problem.\n\nRow 4:1 0 1 1 0 1 → '1 1' is okay, but let's see if it's more than two. No, just two. So okay.\n\nRow 5:0 1 0 1 1 0 → '1 1' is okay.\n\nRow 6:1 0 0 1 0 1 → '0 0' is okay.\n\nColumns:\n\nColumn 1:0,0,1,1,0,1 → No three in a row.\n\nColumn 2:1,0,1,0,1,0 → Alternating, good.\n\nColumn 3:1,1,0,1,0,0 → '1,1' okay.\n\nColumn 4:0,0,1,1,1,1 → Wait, Column 4: 0,0,1,1,1,1 → The last four are 1s. So there are four 1s in a row at the end. That's more than two. So Rule 2 is violated.\n\nSo Option C is invalid.\n\n**Option D:**\n```\n0 1 1 0 1 0\n0 0 1 0 1 1\n1 1 0 1 0 0\n1 0 1 0 0 1\n0 1 0 1 1 0\n1 0 0 1 0 0\n```\n\nRule 2: Check for three in a row.\n\nRow 1:0 1 1 0 1 0 → Fine.\n\nRow 2:0 0 1 0 1 1 → Fine.\n\nRow 3:1 1 0 1 0 0 → Fine.\n\nRow 4:1 0 1 0 0 1 → Fine.\n\nRow 5:0 1 0 1 1 0 → Fine.\n\nRow 6:1 0 0 1 0 0 → '0 0 0' at the end. That's three 0s. So Rule 2 is violated.\n\nSo Option D is invalid.\n\nWait, let me double-check Option D's Row 6: 1 0 0 1 0 0. The last three are 0,0,0. That's three in a row, which is not allowed. So yes, Option D is invalid.\n\nSo, going back, Option A is the only one that satisfies all rules.\n\nBut wait, just to make sure, I should check all the other rules for Option A again.\n\nRule 3: Each row and column has three 0s and three 1s. As I checked earlier, all rows and columns have exactly three of each. So that's good.\n\nRule 4: All rows and columns are unique.\n\nRows in Option A:\n\nRow1: 0 1 1 0 1 0\n\nRow2:0 0 1 0 1 1\n\nRow3:1 1 0 1 0 0\n\nRow4:1 0 1 0 0 1\n\nRow5:0 1 0 1 1 0\n\nRow6:1 0 0 1 0 1\n\nLooking at these, I don't see any duplicates. For example, Row1 is 0,1,1,0,1,0. None of the other rows match that sequence.\n\nColumns:\n\nColumn1:0,0,1,1,0,1\n\nColumn2:1,0,1,0,1,0\n\nColumn3:1,1,0,1,0,0\n\nColumn4:0,0,1,0,1,1\n\nColumn5:1,1,0,0,1,0\n\nColumn6:0,1,0,1,0,1\n\nLooking at each column, none of them repeat. So all columns are unique.\n\nTherefore, Option A satisfies all the rules.

{"question_id": "binairo_1222", "response": "Okay, so I have this Binairo puzzle to solve, and I need to figure out which of the four options (A, B, C, D) is the correct solution. Let me try to work through this step by step, even though I'm a bit new to these kinds of puzzles. I'll start by recalling the rules to make sure I don't miss anything.\n\nFirst, the rules for Binairo are:\n\n1. Each cell must be either a 0 or a 1.\n2. No more than two consecutive identical numbers in any row or column. So, three in a row is not allowed.\n3. Each row and column must have an equal number of 0s and 1s. Since it's a 4x4 grid, each row and column should have exactly two 0s and two 1s.\n4. No two rows can be identical, and no two columns can be identical either.\n\nAlright, so let's look at each option one by one and check these rules.\n\nStarting with **Option A**:\n\nOption A's grid is:\n0 1 1 0\n0 0 1 1\n1 1 0 0\n1 0 0 1\n\nLet me check each row first for the consecutive numbers and the count of 0s and 1s.\n\nRow 1: 0,1,1,0\n- Consecutive check: 1,1 is two, which is allowed. No three in a row.\n- Count: two 0s and two 1s. Good.\n\nRow 2: 0,0,1,1\n- Consecutive check: 0,0 is two, allowed. 1,1 is two, allowed.\n- Count: two 0s and two 1s. Good.\n\nRow 3: 1,1,0,0\n- Similarly, 1,1 is two, and 0,0 is two.\n- Count: two each. Good.\n\nRow 4: 1,0,0,1\n- Consecutive check: 0,0 is two, allowed.\n- Count: two 0s and two 1s. Good.\n\nNow, checking columns for the same.\n\nColumn 1: 0,0,1,1\n- Consecutive: 0,0 is two, 1,1 is two. Allowed.\n- Count: two 0s and two 1s. Good.\n\nColumn 2: 1,0,1,0\n- No consecutive repeats longer than two. It alternates, so no problem.\n- Count: two 0s and two 1s. Good.\n\nColumn 3: 1,1,0,0\n- Same as rows, two each, allowed.\n- Count: two 0s and two 1s. Good.\n\nColumn 4: 0,1,0,1\n- Alternates, so no consecutive repeats. Good.\n- Count: two each. Good.\n\nNow, check for identical rows. Looking at the four rows:\n\nRow 1: 0 1 1 0\n\nRow 2: 0 0 1 1\n\nRow 3: 1 1 0 0\n\nRow 4: 1 0 0 1\n\nNone of these rows are identical. Each is unique.\n\nColumns:\n\nColumn 1: 0,0,1,1\n\nColumn 2:1,0,1,0\n\nColumn 3:1,1,0,0\n\nColumn 4:0,1,0,1\n\nEach column is unique as well. So Option A seems to satisfy all the rules. But I shouldn't jump to conclusions yet; I need to check all options to make sure.\n\nMoving on to **Option B**:\n\nOption B's grid is:\n1 1 1 0\n0 0 1 1\n1 1 0 0\n1 0 0 1\n\nLet's check the rows first.\n\nRow 1:1,1,1,0\n- Oh no, three 1s in a row. That's violating rule 2. So this is invalid. Therefore, Option B is out.\n\nWait, before I proceed, just to be thorough, let me check the rest, but I think that's enough to eliminate B.\n\nBut for completeness:\n\nRow 2:0,0,1,1 – that's okay.\n\nRow 3:1,1,0,0 – okay.\n\nRow 4:1,0,0,1 – okay.\n\nBut since Row 1 has three 1s, Option B is invalid.\n\nSo B is out.\n\nNow, **Option C**:\n\nOption C's grid is:\n0 1 1 0\n0 0 1 1\n1 1 1 0\n1 0 0 1\n\nChecking the rows:\n\nRow 1:0,1,1,0 – okay.\n\nRow 2:0,0,1,1 – okay.\n\nRow 3:1,1,1,0 – Oh, three 1s in a row. That's a violation of rule 2. So Option C is invalid.\n\nMoving on to **Option D**:\n\nOption D's grid is:\n0 1 1 0\n0 0 1 1\n1 1 0 0\n1 0 0 0\n\nChecking the rows first.\n\nRow 1:0,1,1,0 – okay.\n\nRow 2:0,0,1,1 – okay.\n\nRow 3:1,1,0,0 – okay.\n\nRow 4:1,0,0,0 – Oh, here we have three 0s in a row at the end. So that's a violation of rule 2. So Option D is invalid.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\n- A: Valid\n- B: Invalid (Row 1 has three 1s)\n- C: Invalid (Row 3 has three 1s)\n- D: Invalid (Row 4 has three 0s)\n\nTherefore, the only valid option is A.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check Option A for any other possible issues. Maybe I missed something.\n\nLooking again at Option A's grid:\n\n0 1 1 0\n\n0 0 1 1\n\n1 1 0 0\n\n1 0 0 1\n\nCheck each row for two consecutive same numbers:\n\nRow 1: 0,1,1,0 – 1,1 is okay.\n\nRow 2:0,0,1,1 – both pairs are okay.\n\nRow 3:1,1,0,0 – same, okay.\n\nRow 4:1,0,0,1 – 0,0 is okay.\n\nColumns:\n\nColumn 1:0,0,1,1 – okay.\n\nColumn 2:1,0,1,0 – alternates, so no issue.\n\nColumn 3:1,1,0,0 – okay.\n\nColumn 4:0,1,0,1 – alternates, so no issue.\n\nCheck counts:\n\nEach row and column has two 0s and two 1s. That's correct.\n\nCheck for identical rows:\n\nRow 1: 0 1 1 0\n\nRow 2:0 0 1 1\n\nRow 3:1 1 0 0\n\nRow 4:1 0 0 1\n\nAll unique.\n\nColumns:\n\nColumn 1:0,0,1,1\n\nColumn 2:1,0,1,0\n\nColumn 3:1,1,0,0\n\nColumn 4:0,1,0,1\n\nAll columns are unique as well.\n\nSo, I think I didn't miss anything. Option A seems to satisfy all the rules. The other options have at least one row that violates the consecutive rule, so they're out.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be Option A.\n</think>\n\nThe correct answer is Option A because it adheres to all the Binairo rules without any violations. \n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{A}", "ground_truth": "A", "prompt": "You need to solve a Binairo puzzle (Size: 4x4).You need to solve a Binairo puzzle.\n\n**Binairo Puzzle Rules:**\n1.

{"question_id": "binairo_387", "response": "Alright, so I have to solve this Binairo puzzle. It's a 6x6 grid, and I need to choose the correct solution from options A, B, C, or D. Let me go through each option step by step, checking if they meet all the rules.\n\nFirst, I'll recall the rules to make sure I don't miss anything:\n\n1. Each cell must be 0 or 1.\n2. No more than two consecutive identical numbers in any row or column.\n3. Each row and column must have an equal number of 0s and 1s.\n4. No two identical rows or columns.\n\nOkay, let's start with Option A.\n\n**Option A:**\n\n1 1 0 1 0 0  \n0 0 1 1 0 1  \n0 0 1 0 1 1  \n1 1 0 0 1 0  \n0 1 0 1 0 1  \n1 0 1 0 1 0  \n\nLet me check each rule.\n\n**Rule 1:** All cells are 0 or 1. That's satisfied.\n\n**Rule 2:** Check for more than two consecutive same numbers.\n\nLooking at rows:\n\nRow 1: 1 1 0 1 0 0  \n- There's \"1 1\" which is two consecutive 1s. That's okay. The rest don't have more than two in a row.\n\nRow 2: 0 0 1 1 0 1  \n- \"0 0\" and \"1 1\" are both two. No three in a row.\n\nRow 3: 0 0 1 0 1 1  \n- \"0 0\" and \"1 1\" again. Fine.\n\nRow 4: 1 1 0 0 1 0  \n- \"1 1\" and \"0 0\". Okay.\n\nRow 5: 0 1 0 1 0 1  \n- No consecutive same numbers. Good.\n\nRow 6: 1 0 1 0 1 0  \n- Also no consecutive same. Good.\n\nNow columns:\n\nColumn 1: 1,0,0,1,0,1  \n- 1,0,0: 0s are two in a row. Then 1,0,1,0,1. No three.\n\nColumn 2: 1,0,0,1,1,0  \n- 0,0 in columns 2 and 3. Wait, in column 2: 1,0,0,1,1,0. So the first two 0s are at rows 2 and 3. Then in rows 4 and 5, 1,1. So that's two consecutive 1s. So columns have at most two same in a row. So rule 2 is satisfied.\n\n**Rule 3:** Each row and column must have equal 0s and 1s. Since it's a 6x6 grid, each row and column should have 3 zeros and 3 ones.\n\nLet me check rows:\n\nRow 1: 1,1,0,1,0,0 → 3 zeros, 3 ones. Good.\n\nRow 2: 0,0,1,1,0,1 → 3 zeros, 3 ones.\n\nRow 3: 0,0,1,0,1,1 → 3 zeros, 3 ones.\n\nRow 4: 1,1,0,0,1,0 → 3 zeros, 3 ones.\n\nRow 5: 0,1,0,1,0,1 → 3 zeros, 3 ones.\n\nRow 6: 1,0,1,0,1,0 → 3 zeros, 3 ones.\n\nColumns:\n\nColumn 1: 1,0,0,1,0,1 → 3 zeros, 3 ones.\n\nColumn 2: 1,0,0,1,1,0 → 3 zeros, 3 ones.\n\nColumn 3: 0,1,1,0,0,1 → 3 zeros, 3 ones.\n\nColumn 4: 1,1,0,0,1,0 → 3 zeros, 3 ones.\n\nColumn 5: 0,0,1,1,0,1 → 3 zeros, 3 ones.\n\nColumn 6: 0,1,1,0,1,0 → 3 zeros, 3 ones.\n\nAll rows and columns have equal numbers. Good.\n\n**Rule 4:** No two identical rows or columns.\n\nLooking at rows:\n\nRow 1: 1 1 0 1 0 0  \nRow 2: 0 0 1 1 0 1  \nRow 3: 0 0 1 0 1 1  \nRow 4: 1 1 0 0 1 0  \nRow 5: 0 1 0 1 0 1  \nRow 6: 1 0 1 0 1 0  \n\nAll rows look distinct. Let me check:\n\nRow 1 is different from others. Row 2,3,4 also different. Rows 5 and 6 are alternating, but they are different from each other. So rows are unique.\n\nColumns:\n\nEach column is a unique sequence. Let me see:\n\nColumn 1: 1,0,0,1,0,1  \nColumn 2: 1,0,0,1,1,0  \nColumn 3: 0,1,1,0,0,1  \nColumn 4: 1,1,0,0,1,0  \nColumn 5: 0,0,1,1,0,1  \nColumn 6: 0,1,1,0,1,0  \n\nEach column seems unique. So Rule 4 is satisfied.\n\nSo Option A seems to satisfy all rules.\n\nBut let me check other options just in case.\n\n**Option B:**\n\n0 1 0 1 0 0  \n0 0 1 1 0 1  \n0 0 1 0 1 1  \n1 1 0 0 1 0  \n0 1 0 1 0 1  \n1 0 1 0 1 0  \n\nFirst, check for Rule 3: each row and column must have 3 zeros and 3 ones.\n\nLet me check rows:\n\nRow 1: 0,1,0,1,0,0 → counts: zeros: 4, ones: 2. That's unequal. So this row has 4 zeros and 2 ones. So Rule 3 is violated. Therefore, Option B is invalid.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake. Let me recount:\n\nRow 1: 0,1,0,1,0,0. So positions 1,3,5 are 0; that's three 0s. Wait, no: positions 1,3,5,6 are 0. So 4 zeros. Yes, that's a problem. So Rule 3 is violated in row 1. So Option B is invalid.\n\nWait, maybe I miscounted. Let me recount:\n\nRow 1: 0,1,0,1,0,0. So 0 appears in positions 1,3,5,6. That's four 0s and two 1s. So yes, unequal. So Option B is invalid.\n\nSo I can eliminate Option B.\n\n**Option C:**\n\n1 1 0 1 0 0  \n0 0 1 1 0 1  \n0 0 1 0 1 1  \n1 1 0 1 1 0  \n0 1 0 1 0 1  \n1 0 1 0 1 0  \n\nFirst, check Rule 2: no more than two consecutive same numbers.\n\nLooking at rows:\n\nRow 4: 1,1,0,1,1,0  \n- \"1,1\" at the start, then \"1,1\" again in positions 4 and 5. So that's two sets of two 1s. So Rule 2 is okay.\n\nBut wait, let's check columns as well.\n\nColumn 4:\n\nLooking at Column 4 in Option C:\n\nRow1:1, Row2:1, Row3:0, Row4:1, Row5:1, Row6:0.\n\nSo the sequence is 1,1,0,1,1,0.\n\nLooking for three in a row:\n\nPositions 1,2,4,5: 1,1,0,1,1. So between 1,2 is two 1s, then 4,5 is two 1s. No three in a row. So that's okay.\n\nWait, but let me check each row and column for Rule 2.\n\nRow 1: 1,1,0,1,0,0 → two 1s, then two 0s at the end. So that's acceptable.\n\nRow 2: 0,0,1,1,0,1 → two 0s, two 1s. Good.\n\nRow 3: 0,0,1,0,1,1 → two 0s, then two 1s. Good.\n\nRow 4: 1,1,0,1,1,0 → two 1s, two 1s again. So that's okay.\n\nRow 5: 0,1,0,1,0,1 → no consecutive same. Good.\n\nRow 6: 1,0,1,0,1,0 → same.\n\nNow columns:\n\nColumn 1: 1,0,0,1,0,1 → 1,0,0,1,0,1. No more than two same.\n\nColumn 2:1,0,0,1,1,0 → 1,0,0,1,1,0. Two 0s, two 1s.\n\nColumn 3:0,1,1,0,0,1 → 0,1,1,0,0,1. Two 1s, two 0s.\n\nColumn 4:1,1,0,1,1,0 → same as row 4, which is okay.\n\nColumn 5:0,0,1,1,0,1 → two 0s, two 1s.\n\nColumn 6:0,1,1,0,1,0 → two 1s, then two 1s? Wait, Column 6:\n\nRow1:0, Row2:1, Row3:1, Row4:0, Row5:1, Row6:0.\n\nSo the sequence is 0,1,1,0,1,0.\n\nSo positions 2 and 3: 1,1. Then position 5:1, but not consecutive. So that's okay.\n\nSo Rule 2 is satisfied.\n\nNow Rule 3: Each row and column must have 3 0s and 3 1s.\n\nCheck rows:\n\nRow1: 1,1,0,1,0,0 → 3 zeros, 3 ones. Good.\n\nRow2:0,0,1,1,0,1 → 3 zeros, 3 ones.\n\nRow3:0,0,1,0,1,1 → 3 zeros, 3 ones.\n\nRow4:1,1,0,1,1,0 → Let's count: 1,1,0,1,1,0 → 1s: positions 1,2,4,5 → four 1s. 0s: positions 3,6 → two 0s. So that's four 1s and two 0s. So unequal. Therefore, Rule 3 is violated in Row4. So Option C is invalid.\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\nRow4:1,1,0,1,1,0.\n\nNumber of 1s: positions 1,2,4,5 → four 1s.\n\nNumber of 0s: positions 3,6 → two 0s. So total 6 cells: 4+2=6. So it's four 1s and two 0s. Not equal. So Rule 3 is violated.\n\nHence, Option C is invalid.\n\n**Option D:**\n\n1 1 0 1 0 0  \n0 0 1 1 0 1  \n0 0 1 0 1 1  \n1 1 0 0 1 0  \n0 1 0 1 0 1  \n1 0 1 0 1 1  \n\nFirst, check Rule 3: each row and column must have 3 zeros and 3 ones.\n\nCheck Row6: 1,0,1,0,1,1 → 1s: positions 1,3,5,6 → four 1s. 0s: positions 2,4 → two 0s. So unequal. Therefore, Rule 3 is violated in Row6. So Option D is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, let me confirm:\n\nRow6:1,0,1,0,1,1 → count 1s: four, 0s: two. Not equal. So invalid.\n\nSo, among all options, only Option A satisfies all the rules. So the answer should be A.\n</think>\n\nAfter carefully analyzing each option against the rules, Option A is the only one that satisfies all the Binairo puzzle conditions.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n\\boxed{A}", "ground_truth": "A", "prompt": "You need to solve a Binairo puzzle (Size: 6x6).You need to solve a Binairo puzzle.\n\n**Binairo Puzzle Rules:**\n1.

{"question_id": "binairo_985", "response": "Alright, so I have this Binairo puzzle to solve, and I need to figure out which of the four options (A, B, C, D) is correct. Let me try to break this down step by step. I'm not super familiar with Binairo puzzles, but I know the rules, so I'll try to apply them carefully.\n\nFirst, let me list out the rules again to make sure I remember them:\n\n1. Each cell must be 0 or 1.\n2. No more than two consecutive identical numbers in any row or column. So, no three in a row like 000 or 111.\n3. Each row and column must have an equal number of 0s and 1s. Since it's a 6x6 grid, each row and column should have exactly three 0s and three 1s.\n4. No two rows can be identical, and no two columns can be identical.\n\nAlright, so my task is to check each option against these rules. Let me start with Option A.\n\n**Option A:**\n\n```\n0 0 1 1 0 1\n1 0 0 1 1 0\n0 1 1 0 0 1\n0 1 0 0 1 1\n1 0 1 1 0 0\n1 1 0 0 1 0\n```\n\nLet me check each row first for consecutive numbers.\n\nRow 1: 0 0 1 1 0 1\n- Consecutive 0s at the start: two in a row, which is allowed.\n- Then 1 1: two in a row, allowed.\n- Then 0 1: no issue.\nSo row 1 is okay.\n\nRow 2: 1 0 0 1 1 0\n- 1 followed by 0s: no problem.\n- 0 0: allowed.\n- 1 1: allowed.\n- Ends with 0. So row 2 is fine.\n\nRow 3: 0 1 1 0 0 1\n- 0 1: okay.\n- 1 1: allowed.\n- 0 0: allowed.\nSo row 3 is good.\n\nRow 4: 0 1 0 0 1 1\n- 0 1: okay.\n- 0 0: allowed.\n- 1 1: allowed.\nRow 4 is fine.\n\nRow 5: 1 0 1 1 0 0\n- 1 0: okay.\n- 1 1: allowed.\n- 0 0: allowed.\nRow 5 is okay.\n\nRow 6: 1 1 0 0 1 0\n- 1 1: allowed.\n- 0 0: allowed.\n- 1 0: okay.\nSo all rows pass the consecutive check.\n\nNow, let's check if each row has three 0s and three 1s.\n\nRow 1: 0,0,1,1,0,1 → counts as 3 zeros, 3 ones. Good.\nRow 2: 1,0,0,1,1,0 → 3 zeros, 3 ones. Good.\nRow 3: 0,1,1,0,0,1 → 3 zeros, 3 ones. Good.\nRow 4: 0,1,0,0,1,1 → 3 zeros, 3 ones. Good.\nRow 5: 1,0,1,1,0,0 → 3 zeros, 3 ones. Good.\nRow 6: 1,1,0,0,1,0 → 3 zeros, 3 ones. Good.\n\nSo all rows satisfy the count rule.\n\nNow, check if any rows are identical. Let's see:\n\nRow 1: 0 0 1 1 0 1\nRow 2: 1 0 0 1 1 0\nRow 3: 0 1 1 0 0 1\nRow 4: 0 1 0 0 1 1\nRow 5: 1 0 1 1 0 0\nRow 6: 1 1 0 0 1 0\n\nLooking at these, none of them look identical. So rule 4 is satisfied for rows.\n\nNow, check columns for consecutive numbers. Let's go column by column.\n\nColumn 1: 0,1,0,0,1,1\n- 0 followed by 1: okay.\n- 1 followed by 0: okay.\n- 0 followed by 0: allowed (two in a row).\n- 0 followed by 1: okay.\n- 1 followed by 1: allowed (two in a row).\nSo column 1 is fine.\n\nColumn 2: 0,0,1,1,0,1\n- 0,0: allowed.\n- 0 followed by 1: okay.\n- 1 followed by 1: allowed.\n- 1 followed by 0: okay.\n- 0 followed by 1: okay.\nColumn 2 is good.\n\nColumn 3: 1,0,1,0,1,0\n- 1,0: okay.\n- 0,1: okay.\n- 1,0: okay.\n- 0,1: okay.\n- 1,0: okay.\nNo three in a row. So column 3 is fine.\n\nColumn 4: 1,1,0,0,1,0\n- 1,1: allowed.\n- 1 followed by 0: okay.\n- 0 followed by 0: allowed.\n- 0 followed by 1: okay.\n- 1 followed by 0: okay.\nColumn 4 is good.\n\nColumn 5: 0,1,0,1,0,1\n- Alternating 0 and 1. No consecutive duplicates. Good.\n\nColumn 6: 1,0,1,1,0,0\n- 1,0: okay.\n- 0,1: okay.\n- 1,1: allowed.\n- 1 followed by 0: okay.\n- 0,0: allowed.\nSo column 6 is fine.\n\nNow, check if each column has three 0s and three 1s.\n\nColumn 1: 0,1,0,0,1,1 → counts: 3 zeros, 3 ones. Good.\nColumn 2: 0,0,1,1,0,1 → 3 zeros, 3 ones. Good.\nColumn 3: 1,0,1,0,1,0 → 3 zeros, 3 ones. Good.\nColumn 4: 1,1,0,0,1,0 → 3 zeros, 3 ones. Good.\nColumn 5: 0,1,0,1,0,1 → 3 zeros, 3 ones. Good.\nColumn 6: 1,0,1,1,0,0 → 3 zeros, 3 ones. Good.\n\nSo columns pass the count rule.\n\nNow, check if any columns are identical. Let's see:\n\nColumn 1: 0,1,0,0,1,1\nColumn 2: 0,0,1,1,0,1\nColumn 3: 1,0,1,0,1,0\nColumn 4: 1,1,0,0,1,0\nColumn 5: 0,1,0,1,0,1\nColumn 6: 1,0,1,1,0,0\n\nLooking at these, none of them look the same. So rule 4 is satisfied for columns.\n\nSo, Option A passes all the checks. But let me check the other options just to be thorough, because sometimes puzzles can have multiple options satisfying some rules but not all.\n\n**Option B:**\n\n```\n1 0 1 1 0 1\n1 0 0 1 1 0\n0 1 1 0 0 1\n0 1 0 0 1 1\n1 0 1 1 0 0\n1 1 0 0 1 0\n```\n\nFirst, check rows for consecutive numbers.\n\nRow 1: 1 0 1 1 0 1\n- 1,0: okay.\n- 0,1: okay.\n- 1,1: allowed.\n- 1,0: okay.\n- 0,1: okay.\nNo issues here.\n\nRow 2: 1 0 0 1 1 0\n- 1,0: okay.\n- 0,0: allowed.\n- 0,1: okay.\n- 1,1: allowed.\n- 1,0: okay.\nRow 2 is fine.\n\nRow 3: 0 1 1 0 0 1\n- 0,1: okay.\n- 1,1: allowed.\n- 1,0: okay.\n- 0,0: allowed.\n- 0,1: okay.\nRow 3 is okay.\n\nRow 4: 0 1 0 0 1 1\n- 0,1: okay.\n- 1,0: okay.\n- 0,0: allowed.\n- 0,1: okay.\n- 1,1: allowed.\nRow 4 is fine.\n\nRow 5: 1 0 1 1 0 0\n- 1,0: okay.\n- 0,1: okay.\n- 1,1: allowed.\n- 1,0: okay.\n- 0,0: allowed.\nRow 5 is okay.\n\nRow 6: 1 1 0 0 1 0\n- 1,1: allowed.\n- 1,0: okay.\n- 0,0: allowed.\n- 0,1: okay.\n- 1,0: okay.\nSo all rows pass the consecutive check.\n\nNow, check counts for each row.\n\nRow 1: 1,0,1,1,0,1 → 3 ones, 3 zeros. Good.\nRow 2: 1,0,0,1,1,0 → 3 ones, 3 zeros. Good.\nRow 3: 0,1,1,0,0,1 → 3 ones, 3 zeros. Good.\nRow 4: 0,1,0,0,1,1 → 3 ones, 3 zeros. Good.\nRow 5: 1,0,1,1,0,0 → 3 ones, 3 zeros. Good.\nRow 6: 1,1,0,0,1,0 → 3 ones, 3 zeros. Good.\n\nSo rows are fine. Now, check if any rows are identical.\n\nLooking at the rows:\n\nRow 1: 1 0 1 1 0 1\nRow 2: 1 0 0 1 1 0\nRow 3: 0 1 1 0 0 1\nRow 4: 0 1 0 0 1 1\nRow 5: 1 0 1 1 0 0\nRow 6: 1 1 0 0 1 0\n\nThey all look unique. So rule 4 is satisfied for rows.\n\nNow, check columns for consecutive numbers.\n\nColumn 1: 1,1,0,0,1,1\n- 1,1: allowed.\n- 1,0: okay.\n- 0,0: allowed.\n- 0,1: okay.\n- 1,1: allowed.\nSo column 1 is fine.\n\nColumn 2: 0,0,1,1,0,1\n- 0,0: allowed.\n- 0,1: okay.\n- 1,1: allowed.\n- 1,0: okay.\n- 0,1: okay.\nColumn 2 is good.\n\nColumn 3: 1,0,1,0,1,0\n- Alternating, no three in a row. Good.\n\nColumn 4: 1,1,0,0,1,0\n- 1,1: allowed.\n- 1,0: okay.\n- 0,0: allowed.\n- 0,1: okay.\n- 1,0: okay.\nColumn 4 is fine.\n\nColumn 5: 0,1,0,1,0,1\n- Alternating. Good.\n\nColumn 6: 1,0,1,1,0,0\n- 1,0: okay.\n- 0,1: okay.\n- 1,1: allowed.\n- 1,0: okay.\n- 0,0: allowed.\nColumn 6 is good.\n\nNow, check counts for each column.\n\nColumn 1: 1,1,0,0,1,1 → 3 zeros, 3 ones. Good.\nColumn 2: 0,0,1,1,0,1 → 3 zeros, 3 ones. Good.\nColumn 3: 1,0,1,0,1,0 → 3 zeros, 3 ones. Good.\nColumn 4: 1,1,0,0,1,0 → 3 zeros, 3 ones. Good.\nColumn 5: 0,1,0,1,0,1 → 3 zeros, 3 ones. Good.\nColumn 6: 1,0,1,1,0,0 → 3 zeros, 3 ones. Good.\n\nSo columns pass the count rule.\n\nNow, check if any columns are identical.\n\nLooking at the column sequences:\n\nColumn 1: 1,1,0,0,1,1\nColumn 2: 0,0,1,1,0,1\nColumn 3: 1,0,1,0,1,0\nColumn 4: 1,1,0,0,1,0\nColumn 5: 0,1,0,1,0,1\nColumn 6: 1,0,1,1,0,0\n\nThey all look unique. So rule 4 is satisfied for columns.\n\nHmm, so Option B also seems to satisfy all the rules. That's confusing. Maybe I missed something? Let me double-check the rows and columns for any possible duplicates or consecutive issues.\n\nWait, looking at the rows, let me check if any rows are identical. For example, is Row 1 in A different from Row 1 in B? Yes, because in A Row 1 starts with 0,0, while in B it starts with 1,0. So they are different.\n\nBut perhaps columns? Let me see. For example, Column 3 in A is 1,0,1,0,1,0, while in B it's 1,0,1,0,1,0 as well? Wait, no, in B, Column 3 is 1,0,1,0,1,0, which is the same as in A. Wait, but in the rules, no two columns can be identical. So if in A, Column 3 is unique, but in B, if Column 3 is the same as in A, that might not be a problem because each option is a separate puzzle. Wait, no, each option is a separate grid. So within each option, the columns must be unique. So within Option B, are all columns unique? Let's check:\n\nColumns in B:\n\n1: 1,1,0,0,1,1\n2: 0,0,1,1,0,1\n3: 1,0,1,0,1,0\n4: 1,1,0,0,1,0\n5: 0,1,0,1,0,1\n6: 1,0,1,1,0,0\n\nLooking at these, each column is unique. So rule 4 is satisfied.\n\nWait, but if Option A and Option B both satisfy all the rules, that can't be, because the question states that there is a correct answer. So perhaps I made a mistake in checking.\n\nWait, maybe in one of the options, the columns have duplicates. Let me check again.\n\nIn Option A, columns are:\n\n1: 0,1,0,0,1,1\n2: 0,0,1,1,0,1\n3: 1,0,1,0,1,0\n4: 1,1,0,0,1,0\n5: 0,1,0,1,0,1\n6: 1,0,1,1,0,0\n\nAll unique.\n\nIn Option B, columns are:\n\n1: 1,1,0,0,1,1\n2: 0,0,1,1,0,1\n3: 1,0,1,0,1,0\n4: 1,1,0,0,1,0\n5: 0,1,0,1,0,1\n6: 1,0,1,1,0,0\n\nWait, looking at column 4 in B: 1,1,0,0,1,0\n\nColumn 6 in B: 1,0,1,1,0,0\n\nAre any columns in B identical? Let me compare each pair.\n\nColumn 1 vs Column 2: No\nColumn 1 vs Column 3: No\nColumn 1 vs Column 4: No\nColumn 1 vs Column 5: No\nColumn 1 vs Column 6: No\n\nColumn 2 vs Column 3: No\nColumn 2 vs Column 4: No\nColumn 2 vs Column 5: No\nColumn 2 vs Column 6: No\n\nColumn 3 vs Column 4: No\nColumn 3 vs Column 5: No\nColumn 3 vs Column 6: No\n\nColumn 4 vs Column 5: No\nColumn 4 vs Column 6: No\n\nColumn 5 vs Column 6: No\n\nSo all columns in B are unique.\n\nWait, so both A and B pass all the rules. That can't be. Maybe I missed something else.\n\nWait, let me check if in any row or column, there's a triplet. Because sometimes the way I scan might miss it.\n\nLet me recheck Option A's columns:\n\nColumn 1: 0,1,0,0,1,1 → No triplets.\nColumn 2: 0,0,1,1,0,1 → 00 and 11, which are okay.\nColumn 3: 1,0,1,0,1,0 → Alternating, fine.\nColumn 4: 1,1,0,0,1,0 → 11 and 00, allowed.\nColumn 5: 0,1,0,1,0,1 → Alternating, fine.\nColumn 6: 1,0,1,1,0,0 → 11 and 00, allowed.\n\nSimilarly for Option B.\n\nWait, maybe the issue is with the rows. Let me check if any row in Option A is identical to another row in the same option.\n\nLooking at Option A's rows:\n\nRow 1: 0 0 1 1 0 1\nRow 2: 1 0 0 1 1 0\nRow 3: 0 1 1 0 0 1\nRow 4: 0 1 0 0 1 1\nRow 5: 1 0 1 1 0 0\nRow 6: 1 1 0 0 1 0\n\nAll unique.\n\nSimilarly for Option B.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is with the columns in Option C or D. Let me check Option C.\n\n**Option C:**\n\n```\n0 0 1 1 0 1\n1 0 0 1 1 0\n0 1 1 0 0 1\n0 1 0 1 1 1\n1 0 1 1 0 0\n1 1 0 0 1 0\n```\n\nFirst, check rows for consecutive numbers.\n\nRow 1: 0 0 1 1 0 1 → Fine.\nRow 2: 1 0 0 1 1 0 → Fine.\nRow 3: 0 1 1 0 0 1 → Fine.\nRow 4: 0 1 0 1 1 1 → Let's see: 0,1,0,1,1,1. The last three are 1,1,1. Oh no! That's three consecutive 1s. That's not allowed. So row 4 in Option C violates rule 2.\n\nTherefore, Option C is invalid.\n\n**Option D:**\n\n```\n0 0 1 1 0 1\n1 0 0 1 1 0\n0 1 1 0 0 1\n0 1 0 0 1 1\n1 0 1 1 0 0\n1 1 0 0 1 1\n```\n\nCheck rows for consecutive numbers.\n\nRow 1: 0 0 1 1 0 1 → Fine.\nRow 2: 1 0 0 1 1 0 → Fine.\nRow 3: 0 1 1 0 0 1 → Fine.\nRow 4: 0 1 0 0 1 1 → Fine.\nRow 5: 1 0 1 1 0 0 → Fine.\nRow 6: 1 1 0 0 1 1 → Let's check: 1,1,0,0,1,1. The first two are 1s, allowed. Then 0,0 allowed. Then 1,1 allowed. So row 6 is fine.\n\nNow, check counts for each row.\n\nRow 1: 3 zeros, 3 ones. Good.\nRow 2: 3 zeros, 3 ones. Good.\nRow 3: 3 zeros, 3 ones. Good.\nRow 4: 3 zeros, 3 ones. Good.\nRow 5: 3 zeros, 3 ones. Good.\nRow 6: 3 zeros, 3 ones. Good.\n\nNow, check if any rows are identical.\n\nLooking at the rows:\n\nRow 1: 0 0 1 1 0 1\nRow 2: 1 0 0 1 1 0\nRow 3: 0 1 1 0 0 1\nRow 4: 0 1 0 0 1 1\nRow 5: 1 0 1 1 0 0\nRow 6: 1 1 0 0 1 1\n\nThey all look unique. So rule 4 is satisfied for rows.\n\nNow, check columns for consecutive numbers.\n\nColumn 1: 0,1,0,0,1,1 → 00 and 11, allowed.\nColumn 2: 0,0,1,1,0,1 → 00 and 11, allowed.\nColumn 3: 1,0,1,0,1,0 → Alternating, fine.\nColumn 4: 1,1,0,0,1,0 → 11 and 00, allowed.\nColumn 5: 0,1,0,1,0,1 → Alternating, fine.\nColumn 6: 1,0,1,1,0,1 → Ends with 1,0,1. Wait, let's check:\n\nColumn 6: 1,0,1,1,0,1\n- 1,0: okay.\n- 0,1: okay.\n- 1,1: allowed.\n- 1,0: okay.\n- 0,1: okay.\nSo no three in a row. Fine.\n\nNow, check counts for each column.\n\nColumn 1: 0,1,0,0,1,1 → 3 zeros, 3 ones. Good.\nColumn 2: 0,0,1,1,0,1 → 3 zeros, 3 ones. Good.\nColumn 3: 1,0,1,0,1,0 → 3 zeros, 3 ones. Good.\nColumn 4: 1,1,0,0,1,0 → 3 zeros, 3 ones. Good.\nColumn 5: 0,1,0,1,0,1 → 3 zeros, 3 ones. Good.\nColumn 6: 1,0,1,1,0,1 → 3 zeros, 3 ones. Good.\n\nSo columns pass the count rule.\n\nNow, check if any columns are identical.\n\nLooking at the column sequences:\n\nColumn 1: 0,1,0,0,1,1\nColumn 2: 0,0,1,1,0,1\nColumn 3: 1,0,1,0,1,0\nColumn 4: 1,1,0,0,1,0\nColumn 5: 0,1,0,1,0,1\nColumn 6: 1,0,1,1,0,1\n\nThey all look unique. So rule 4 is satisfied for columns.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought Option A was correct, but now Option D also seems to satisfy all the rules. Hmm.\n\nBut wait, let me look at Option D's rows and columns more carefully. Maybe I missed something.\n\nLooking at Option D's Row 6: 1 1 0 0 1 1\n\nThat's 1,1,0,0,1,1. That's allowed because there are no three in a row. So that's fine.\n\nNow, check columns again.\n\nColumn 6 in D: 1,0,1,1,0,1\n\nLet me see: 1,0,1,1,0,1\n\n- 1,0: okay.\n- 0,1: okay.\n- 1,1: allowed.\n- 1,0: okay.\n- 0,1: okay.\nNo three in a row, so it's fine.\n\nNow, let me compare Option A and Option D.\n\nWait, but the question says \"choose the correct grid configuration from the options below that represents the solution to the puzzle.\" So if both A and D satisfy all the rules, perhaps I made a mistake in my analysis.\n\nWait, let me check Option D's Row 6 again. It's 1 1 0 0 1 1.\n\nWait, but looking at the column 6 in D, which is 1,0,1,1,0,1.\n\nWait, but in Row 6, the last two are 1s, but in column 6, the last two are 0 and 1. Wait, no, column 6 in D is:\n\nRow 1: 1\nRow 2: 0\nRow 3: 1\nRow 4: 1\nRow 5: 0\nRow 6: 1\n\nSo column 6 is 1,0,1,1,0,1. So in row 6, column 6 is 1, which is fine.\n\nWait, but I'm getting confused. Let me try another approach. Since both A and D seem to satisfy the rules, but the question says there's a correct answer, perhaps I need to look for something else.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed that in Option A, some rows or columns are identical. Let me check again.\n\nIn Option A, rows are:\n\n0 0 1 1 0 1\n1 0 0 1 1 0\n0 1 1 0 0 1\n0 1 0 0 1 1\n1 0 1 1 0 0\n1 1 0 0 1 0\n\nAll unique.\n\nIn Option D, rows are:\n\n0 0 1 1 0 1\n1 0 0 1 1 0\n0 1 1 0 0 1\n0 1 0 0 1 1\n1 0 1 1 0 0\n1 1 0 0 1 1\n\nWait, comparing rows 1 to 5 in A and D, they are the same. Only row 6 differs. So in Option A, row 6 is 1 1 0 0 1 0, while in Option D, row 6 is 1 1 0 0 1 1.\n\nSo in Option A, row 6 ends with 0, while in D, it ends with 1.\n\nBut wait, in Option D, row 6 is 1 1 0 0 1 1. That's three 1s at the end? Wait, no, it's 1,1,0,0,1,1. So it's 1,1, then 0,0, then 1,1. So no three in a row. It's allowed.\n\nBut wait, in Option D, row 6: 1 1 0 0 1 1\n\nSo positions 5 and 6 are 1,1. So that's allowed, as it's only two in a row.\n\nWait, but in Option A, row 6 is 1 1 0 0 1 0, which is allowed as well.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Maybe I should look for something else.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that in Option D, column 6 has 1,0,1,1,0,1, which is okay, but let me check if any column has three in a row.\n\nWait, no, because in column 6, the only two consecutive are 1,1 in the middle. So that's allowed.\n\nWait, maybe I should check if the number of 0s and 1s is correct.\n\nIn Option A, each row and column has three 0s and three 1s, as I checked earlier.\n\nSame for Option D.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that in Option D, the columns have duplicates. Let me check columns in D again.\n\nColumn 1: 0,1,0,0,1,1 → Unique.\nColumn 2: 0,0,1,1,0,1 → Unique.\nColumn 3: 1,0,1,0,1,0 → Unique.\nColumn 4: 1,1,0,0,1,0 → Unique.\nColumn 5: 0,1,0,1,0,1 → Unique.\nColumn 6: 1,0,1,1,0,1 → Unique.\n\nSo all columns are unique.\n\nWait, but then both A and D satisfy all the rules. That can't be, because the question states there's a correct answer.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me check the options again.\n\nWait, looking back, the user provided the options as:\n\nOption A:\n0 0 1 1 0 1\n1 0 0 1 1 0\n0 1 1 0 0 1\n0 1 0 0 1 1\n1 0 1 1 0 0\n1 1 0 0 1 0\n\nOption B:\n1 0 1 1 0 1\n1 0 0 1 1 0\n0 1 1 0 0 1\n0 1 0 0 1 1\n1 0 1 1 0 0\n1 1 0 0 1 0\n\nOption C:\n0 0 1 1 0 1\n1 0 0 1 1 0\n0 1 1 0 0 1\n0 1 0 1 1 1\n1 0 1 1 0 0\n1 1 0 0 1 0\n\nOption D:\n0 0 1 1 0 1\n1 0 0 1 1 0\n0 1 1 0 0 1\n0 1 0 0 1 1\n1 0 1 1 0 0\n1 1 0 0 1 1\n\nWait, in Option D, row 6 is 1 1 0 0 1 1. So in that row, the last two are 1s, making it two 1s, which is allowed. But in that row, are there any three in a row? Let's see: 1,1,0,0,1,1.\n\nNo, because the 1s are separated by 0s. So that's fine.\n\nWait, but perhaps in Option D, the columns have duplicates. Let me check.\n\nLooking at Option D's columns:\n\nColumn 1: 0,1,0,0,1,1\nColumn 2: 0,0,1,1,0,1\nColumn 3: 1,0,1,0,1,0\nColumn 4: 1,1,0,0,1,0\nColumn 5: 0,1,0,1,0,1\nColumn 6: 1,0,1,1,0,1\n\nComparing these to each other, they are all unique.\n\nWait, but in Option A, Column 6 is 1,0,1,1,0,0.\n\nIn Option D, Column 6 is 1,0,1,1,0,1.\n\nSo they are different.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check if in Option D, any row is identical to another row in the same option.\n\nLooking at Option D's rows:\n\nRow 1: 0 0 1 1 0 1\nRow 2: 1 0 0 1 1 0\nRow 3: 0 1 1 0 0 1\nRow 4: 0 1 0 0 1 1\nRow 5: 1 0 1 1 0 0\nRow 6: 1 1 0 0 1 1\n\nAll rows are unique.\n\nHmm, this is perplexing. Both A and D seem valid. But the question says only one is correct. Maybe I need to check if any of the options have more than two consecutive in a row or column that I missed.\n\nWait, in Option D, let's look at Column 4: 1,1,0,0,1,0.\n\nThat's 1,1 at the start, allowed. Then 0,0 allowed. Then 1,0: okay.\n\nIn Option A, Column 4 is 1,1,0,0,1,0 as well? Wait, no.\n\nOption A's Column 4 is:\n\nRow 1: 1\nRow 2: 1\nRow 3: 0\nRow 4: 0\nRow 5: 1\nRow 6: 0\n\nSo 1,1,0,0,1,0. Which is the same as in D.\n\nWait, no, in D, Column 4 is:\n\nRow 1: 1\nRow 2: 1\nRow 3: 0\nRow 4: 0\nRow 5: 1\nRow 6: 0\n\nSame as A's Column 4. So in both A and D, Column 4 is the same. But within each option, columns must be unique. So if in Option A, Column 4 is unique, and in Option D, Column 4 is also unique within D, then that's fine.\n\nWait, but in Option D, Column 4 is 1,1,0,0,1,0, which is same as in A's Column 4, but since each option is a separate puzzle, that's okay. It's only within each option that columns must be unique.\n\nSo both A and D pass all the rules. That can't be. So perhaps I missed something.\n\nWait, let me check the counts again. Maybe in one of the options, a row or column doesn't have exactly three 0s and 1s.\n\nWait, in Option A, all rows and columns have three 0s and 1s.\n\nIn Option D, same.\n\nWait, maybe the issue is that in Option D, the last row has three 1s? No, it's 1,1,0,0,1,1. That's two 1s, then two 0s, then two 1s. So no three in a row.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that in Option D, the columns have duplicates. Let me check each column in D:\n\nColumn 1: 0,1,0,0,1,1 → 3 zeros, 3 ones.\nColumn 2: 0,0,1,1,0,1 → 3 zeros, 3 ones.\nColumn 3: 1,0,1,0,1,0 → 3 zeros, 3 ones.\nColumn 4: 1,1,0,0,1,0 → 3 zeros, 3 ones.\nColumn 5:", "ground_truth": "A", "prompt": "You need to solve a Binairo puzzle (Size: 6x6).You need to solve a Binairo puzzle.\n\n**Binairo Puzzle Rules:**\n1.

{"question_id": "binairo_435", "response": "Okay, so I've got this Binairo puzzle to solve, and I need to figure out which of the four options is correct. Let me start by recalling the rules to make sure I don't miss anything.\n\nFirst, each cell must be either a 0 or a 1. That's straightforward. Next, there can't be more than two consecutive identical numbers in any row or column. So, no three 0s or 1s in a row anywhere. Then, each row and column must have an equal number of 0s and 1s. Since it's a 4x4 grid, each row and column should have exactly two 0s and two 1s. Finally, no two rows or columns can be identical. So, every row must be unique, and every column must also be unique.\n\nAlright, let's go through each option one by one.\n\nStarting with Option A:\n```\n0 1 1 0\n1 0 1 0\n0 1 0 1\n1 0 0 1\n```\nLet me check each row first. \n\nRow 1: 0,1,1,0. Are there more than two consecutive identical numbers? Looking at it, there are two 1s in a row, which is allowed. Each row has two 0s and two 1s, so that's good. No immediate problems here.\n\nRow 2: 1,0,1,0. Alternating, so no consecutive duplicates. Perfect.\n\nRow 3: 0,1,0,1. Also alternating. Good.\n\nRow 4: 1,0,0,1. Here, there are two 0s in a row. Wait, that's two consecutive, which is allowed. So that's fine.\n\nNow, let's check the columns.\n\nColumn 1: 0,1,0,1. Alternating, no consecutive duplicates. Good.\n\nColumn 2: 1,0,1,0. Same here, alternating. Perfect.\n\nColumn 3: 1,1,0,0. Oh, wait, in column 3, the first two are 1s. That's two consecutive 1s, which is allowed. Then the next two are 0s, which is also two in a row, allowed. So that's okay.\n\nColumn 4: 0,0,1,1. Similarly, two 0s then two 1s. Allowed. So columns are okay.\n\nNow, uniqueness of rows and columns. Let's look at the rows:\n\nRow 1: 0 1 1 0\nRow 2: 1 0 1 0\nRow 3: 0 1 0 1\nRow 4: 1 0 0 1\n\nAre any of these rows identical? Row 1 and Row 4: No. Row 2 is different from the others. Row 3 is different. So all rows are unique.\n\nColumns:\n\nColumn 1: 0,1,0,1\nColumn 2:1,0,1,0\nColumn 3:1,1,0,0\nColumn 4:0,0,1,1\n\nAre any columns identical? Column 1 and Column 2 are different. Column 3 is 1,1,0,0 and Column 4 is 0,0,1,1, which are reverses but not identical. So all columns are unique. \n\nSo, Option A seems to satisfy all the rules. But let me check the other options just to be sure.\n\nOption B:\n```\n1 1 1 0\n1 0 1 0\n0 1 0 1\n1 0 0 1\n```\nLooking at Row 1: 1,1,1,0. Oh, wait, that's three 1s in a row. That's not allowed because we can't have more than two consecutive identical numbers. So Option B is invalid. I don't need to check further.\n\nOption C:\n```\n0 1 1 0\n1 0 1 0\n0 1 1 1\n1 0 0 1\n```\nChecking Row 3: 0,1,1,1. That's three 1s at the end. That's invalid because of three consecutive 1s. So Option C is out.\n\nOption D:\n```\n0 1 1 0\n1 0 1 0\n0 1 0 1\n1 0 0 0\n```\nLooking at Row 4: 1,0,0,0. That's three 0s at the end. Not allowed, so Option D is invalid.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Did I miss anything?\n\nIn Option A, all rows and columns have exactly two 0s and two 1s. Rows are unique, columns are unique. No three consecutive same numbers. So Option A should be the correct answer. \n\nWait a second, but let me check the columns again for Option A. Column 3 is 1,1,0,0. So that's two 1s followed by two 0s. That's allowed because it's exactly two. Similarly, Column 4 is 0,0,1,1, which is two 0s and two 1s, also allowed. \n\nI think I'm confident now. Option A is the only one that meets all the criteria. So the answer must be A.\n</think>\n\nThe correct answer is Option A. It satisfies all the Binairo rules: no more than two consecutive identical numbers, equal numbers of 0s and 1s in each row and column, and all rows and columns are unique.\n\n\\boxed{A}", "ground_truth": "A", "prompt": "You need to solve a Binairo puzzle (Size: 4x4).You need to solve a Binairo puzzle.\n\n**Binairo Puzzle Rules:**\n1.

{"question_id": "binairo_564", "response": "Alright, I'm trying to solve this Binairo puzzle. It's a 4x4 grid, and I need to figure out which of the options (A, B, C, or D) is correct. Let me go through each option step by step, checking against the rules.\n\nFirst, let me recap the rules:\n\n1. Each cell must be 0 or 1.\n2. No more than two consecutive identical numbers in any row or column. So, no three in a row.\n3. Each row and column must have an equal number of 0s and 1s. Since it's 4x4, that means two 0s and two 1s in each row and column.\n4. No two rows can be identical, and no two columns can be identical.\n\nOkay, let's look at each option.\n\n**Option A:**\n```\n1 0 0 1\n1 0 1 0\n0 1 1 0\n0 1 0 1\n```\n\nLet me check each row for the consecutive rule and the count of 0s and 1s.\n\nRow 1: 1,0,0,1\n- Consecutive: 0,0 is two, which is allowed. No three in a row. Count: two 0s and two 1s. Good.\n\nRow 2: 1,0,1,0\n- Alternating, so no consecutive duplicates. Count: two 0s and two 1s. Good.\n\nRow 3: 0,1,1,0\n- Consecutive 1s: two, allowed. Count: two 0s and two 1s. Good.\n\nRow 4: 0,1,0,1\n- Alternating, no duplicates. Count: two 0s and two 1s. Good.\n\nNow, checking columns:\n\nColumn 1: 1,1,0,0\n- Two 1s, then two 0s. No three in a row. Count: two 1s and two 0s. Good.\n\nColumn 2: 0,0,1,1\n- Two 0s, then two 1s. No three in a row. Count: two each. Good.\n\nColumn 3: 0,1,1,0\n- Consecutive 1s: two, allowed. Count: two 0s and two 1s. Good.\n\nColumn 4: 1,0,0,1\n- Two 0s, allowed. Count: two 0s and two 1s. Good.\n\nNow, uniqueness of rows and columns.\n\nRows:\n1: 1,0,0,1\n2: 1,0,1,0\n3: 0,1,1,0\n4: 0,1,0,1\n\nAre any rows identical?

So, Option B is invalid. I can skip checking further.\n\n**Option C:**\n```\n1 0 0 1\n1 0 1 0\n0 1 0 0\n0 1 0 1\n```\n\nLet me check rows.\n\nRow 1: 1,0,0,1 – good.\n\nRow 2: 1,0,1,0 – good.\n\nRow 3: 0,1,0,0\n- Consecutive 0s at the end: two, which is allowed. Count: three 0s and one 1. Oh, wait! That's three 0s and one 1. That's not equal. Each row must have two 0s and two 1s. So, Row 3 has three 0s, which violates rule 3. Therefore, Option C is invalid.\n\n**Option D:**\n```\n1 0 0 1\n1 0 1 0\n0 1 1 0\n0 1 0 0\n```\n\nChecking rows.\n\nRow 1: 1,0,0,1 – good.\n\nRow 2: 1,0,1,0 – good.\n\nRow 3: 0,1,1,0 – good.\n\nRow 4: 0,1,0,0\n- Consecutive 0s at the end: two, which is allowed. But count: three 0s and one 1. Again, unequal. So, Row 4 has three 0s, which violates rule 3. So, Option D is invalid.\n\nSo, only Option A satisfies all the rules.

Since it's a 4x4 grid, that means two 0s and two 1s in each row and column.\n4. No two rows or columns can be identical.\n\nOkay, now I'll look at the options provided: A, B, C, D. I need to check each one against these rules.\n\nStarting with Option A:\n\nOption A:\n0 0 1 1\n0 1 0 1\n1 1 0 0\n1 0 1 0\n\nLet me check each row first.\n\nRow 1: 0 0 1 1. Are there three consecutive same numbers? No. Each row has two 0s and two 1s. Good.\n\nRow 2: 0 1 0 1. No consecutive repeats, and two 0s and two 1s. Good.\n\nRow 3: 1 1 0 0. Again, no three in a row. Two 1s and two 0s. Good.\n\nRow 4: 1 0 1 0. No consecutive repeats, two of each. Good.\n\nNow, check columns:\n\nColumn 1: 0,0,1,1. Let's see: 0,0 is two consecutive, which is allowed. Then 1,1 is also two consecutive. So, no three in a row, but each column has two 0s and two 1s. Wait, but the first two are 0s, then 1s. So, does that violate any rule? Rule 2 says no more than two consecutive. So two is okay, so this is fine.\n\nColumn 2: 0,1,1,0. Let's see: 0,1 is fine. Then 1,1 is two, which is allowed. Then 1,0 is fine. So, two 1s in a row, which is okay. Each column has two 0s and two 1s. Good.\n\nColumn 3: 1,0,0,1. 1,0 is fine. Then 0,0 is two, which is allowed. Then 0,1 is fine. Two 0s in a row, okay. Two 1s in column 3? Wait, column 3 has 1,0,0,1. So 1,0,0,1: that's two 0s and two 1s. Good.\n\nColumn 4: 1,1,0,0. Similar to column 1. Two 1s, then two 0s. Allowed. Two of each. Good.\n\nNow, check if any rows are identical. Let's see:\n\nRow 1: 0011\nRow 2: 0101\nRow 3: 1100\nRow 4: 1010\n\nAll rows are unique.

Two 0s and two 1s? Let's count: 1,0,1,1 has three 1s. Wait, that's three 1s and one 0. That violates rule 3, which requires two 0s and two 1s. So Option B is invalid. So I can eliminate B.\n\nOption C:\n0 0 1 1\n0 1 0 1\n1 1 1 0\n1 0 1 0\n\nCheck rows:\n\nRow 1: 0,0,1,1. Two 0s, two 1s. Good.\n\nRow 2: 0,1,0,1. Two each. Good.\n\nRow 3: 1,1,1,0. Uh-oh, three 1s in a row. Violates rule 2. Also, three 1s and one 0, so violates rule 3. So Option C is invalid.\n\nOption D:\n0 0 1 1\n0 1 0 1\n1 1 0 0\n1 0 1 1\n\nCheck rows:\n\nRow 1: 0,0,1,1.

{"question_id": "binairo_1316", "response": "Okay, so I have this Binairo puzzle to solve, and I'm supposed to choose the correct option from A, B, C, or D. The puzzle is 4x4, which is a manageable size, but I need to be careful because each rule is important.\n\nFirst, let me recall the rules to make sure I don't miss anything:\n\n1. Each cell must be 0 or 1.\n2. No more than two consecutive identical numbers in any row or column. So, patterns like 000 or 111 are forbidden.\n3. Each row and column must have an equal number of 0s and 1s. Since it's a 4x4 grid, each row and column must have exactly two 0s and two 1s.\n4. No two rows can be identical, and no two columns can be identical either.\n\nAlright, so I need to check each option against these rules. Let me go through each option one by one.\n\n**Option A:**\n```\n1 0 1 0\n0 1 0 1\n0 1 1 0\n1 0 0 1\n```\n\nLet me check each row first.\n\nRow 1: 1 0 1 0. That's alternating, so no three in a row. Good. Also, two 1s and two 0s. Good.\n\nRow 2: 0 1 0 1. Same as row 1, but shifted. Also alternating, so no three in a row. Two of each. Good.\n\nRow 3: 0 1 1 0. Wait, here we have two 1s in a row. That's allowed because the rule says no more than two consecutive. So two is okay. So, this row is acceptable. Two 1s and two 0s. Good.\n\nRow 4: 1 0 0 1. Again, two 0s in the middle. Allowed. Two 1s and two 0s. Good.\n\nNow, check for identical rows. Rows 1 and 2 are both alternating, but are they identical? Let's see: Row 1 is 1,0,1,0; Row 2 is 0,1,0,1. They are not identical because the starting number is different. So they are distinct. Rows 3 and 4: Row 3 is 0,1,1,0; Row 4 is 1,0,0,1. Also different. So no identical rows.\n\nNow check columns. Let's go column by column.\n\nColumn 1: 1,0,0,1. So two 1s and two 0s. Also, no more than two consecutive. It goes 1,0,0,1. There's two 0s in the middle, which is okay. No three in a row anywhere.\n\nColumn 2: 0,1,1,0. Similarly, two 1s and two 0s. Two 1s in the middle, which is allowed. Good.\n\nColumn 3: 1,0,1,0. Alternating, so no three in a row. Two 1s and two 0s. Good.\n\nColumn 4: 0,1,0,1. Alternating, same as column 3. Good.\n\nNow, check for identical columns. Column 1: 1,0,0,1. Column 2: 0,1,1,0. Different. Column 3: 1,0,1,0. Column 4: 0,1,0,1. So all columns are unique because each has a different pattern. So rule 4 is satisfied.\n\nSo Option A seems to satisfy all rules. But wait, let me check the other options to make sure.\n\n**Option B:**\n```\n0 0 1 0\n0 1 0 1\n0 1 1 0\n1 0 0 1\n```\n\nFirst, check each row.\n\nRow 1: 0 0 1 0. Here, the first two are 0s. So two consecutive 0s, which is allowed. Two 1s and two 0s. Good.\n\nRow 2: 0 1 0 1. Alternating, good.\n\nRow 3: 0 1 1 0. Two 1s in the middle, allowed.\n\nRow 4: 1 0 0 1. Two 0s, allowed.\n\nNow, check for identical rows. Row 1 is 0,0,1,0. Row 2 is 0,1,0,1. Row 3 is 0,1,1,0. Row 4 is 1,0,0,1. All rows are different. Good.\n\nNow columns:\n\nColumn 1: 0,0,0,1. Wait, that's three 0s in a row? Let me count: first three entries are 0,0,0. That's three 0s, which violates rule 2. Because no more than two consecutive identical numbers. So column 1 has three 0s, which is invalid. Therefore, Option B is invalid.\n\nSo I can eliminate Option B.\n\n**Option C:**\n```\n1 0 1 0\n0 1 0 1\n0 1 0 0\n1 0 0 1\n```\n\nCheck rows.\n\nRow 1: 1 0 1 0. Alternating, good.\n\nRow 2: 0 1 0 1. Alternating, good.\n\nRow 3: 0 1 0 0. Two 0s at the end. Allowed.\n\nRow 4: 1 0 0 1. Two 0s, allowed.\n\nNow, check for identical rows. Rows 1 and 2 are distinct. Rows 3 and 4 are also distinct.\n\nNow columns.\n\nColumn 1: 1,0,0,1. Two 1s and two 0s. Also, 1,0,0,1 – no more than two consecutive. Good.\n\nColumn 2: 0,1,1,0. Two 1s, allowed. Good.\n\nColumn 3: 1,0,0,0. Wait, that's three 0s at the end. So in column 3, from row 3 to row 4, we have 0,0,0. That's three 0s in a column, which violates rule 2. So Option C is invalid.\n\nSo I can eliminate Option C.\n\n**Option D:**\n```\n1 0 1 0\n0 1 0 1\n0 1 1 0\n1 0 0 0\n```\n\nCheck rows.\n\nRow 1: 1 0 1 0. Good.\n\nRow 2: 0 1 0 1. Good.\n\nRow 3: 0 1 1 0. Two 1s, allowed.\n\nRow 4: 1 0 0 0. Oh, wait, the last three are 0s. So that's three 0s in a row. That's a violation of rule 2. So Option D is invalid.\n\nSo, the only option that hasn't been eliminated is Option A. Let me just double-check Option A once more.\n\nOption A's rows:\n\n1: 1 0 1 0 – okay.\n\n2: 0 1 0 1 – okay.\n\n3: 0 1 1 0 – okay.\n\n4: 1 0 0 1 – okay.\n\nColumns:\n\n1: 1,0,0,1 – two 0s in the middle, allowed.\n\n2: 0,1,1,0 – two 1s, allowed.\n\n3: 1,0,1,0 – alternating, okay.\n\n4: 0,1,0,1 – alternating, okay.\n\nNo identical rows or columns. All rows and columns have exactly two 0s and two 1s. And no three in a row anywhere.

{"question_id": "binairo_489", "response": "Okay, so I have this Binairo puzzle to solve, and I need to figure out which of the four options (A, B, C, D) is the correct solution. Let me start by recalling the rules of Binairo to make sure I don't miss anything.\n\nFirst, each cell must be either a 0 or a 1. That's straightforward. Next, no more than two consecutive identical numbers in any row or column. So, I can't have three 0s or 1s in a row or column. Third, each row and column must have an equal number of 0s and 1s. Since it's a 4x4 grid, each row and column should have exactly two 0s and two 1s. Finally, no two rows or columns can be identical. That means all four rows must be unique, and all four columns must be unique as well.\n\nAlright, let's go through each option one by one and check these conditions.\n\nStarting with Option A:\n```\n0 1 0 1\n0 1 1 0\n1 0 1 0\n1 0 0 1\n```\n\nLet me check each row first for the consecutive numbers and the count of 0s and 1s.\n\nRow 1: 0,1,0,1. No three in a row. 0s: 2, 1s: 2. Good.\nRow 2: 0,1,1,0. No three in a row. 0s: 2, 1s: 2. Good.\nRow 3: 1,0,1,0. No three in a row. 0s: 2, 1s: 2. Good.\nRow 4: 1,0,0,1. Wait, there are two 0s in a row here. That's okay because the rule is no more than two, so two is allowed. 0s: 2, 1s: 2. Good.\n\nNow, checking columns:\n\nColumn 1: 0,0,1,1. Let's see, 0,0 is two in a row, which is fine. Then 1,1 is also two in a row. So, okay. Total 0s: 2, 1s: 2. Good.\nColumn 2: 1,1,0,0. Same as column 1. Two 1s, then two 0s. Fine. 0s: 2, 1s: 2.\nColumn 3: 0,1,1,0. Hmm, 1,1 in the middle. Two in a row, allowed. 0s: 2, 1s: 2. Good.\nColumn 4: 1,0,0,1. Again, two 0s in the middle. Allowed. 0s: 2, 1s: 2. Good.\n\nNow, checking if any rows are identical. Rows 1 and 3 are both alternating 0 and 1, but they're the same? Let me see:\n\nRow 1: 0,1,0,1\nRow 3: 1,0,1,0\n\nOh, wait, they are reverses of each other. So they are not identical, so that's okay. Similarly, Row 2 is 0,1,1,0. Row 4 is 1,0,0,1. These are also reverses. So no two rows are identical.\n\nNow, checking columns for uniqueness. Let's list each column:\n\nColumn 1: 0,0,1,1\nColumn 2: 1,1,0,0\nColumn 3: 0,1,1,0\nColumn 4: 1,0,0,1\n\nAre any of these columns identical? Let's compare:\n\nColumn 1: 0,0,1,1\nColumn 2: 1,1,0,0 – reverse of column 1. So not identical.\nColumn 3: 0,1,1,0\nColumn 4: 1,0,0,1 – reverse of column 3.

There are two 1s at the beginning, which is allowed. Then a 0, then a 1. No three in a row. 0s: 1, 1s: 3. Wait, that's a problem. Each row must have exactly two 0s and two 1s. Here, row 1 has only one 0 and three 1s. So that's invalid. So Option B is out.\n\nOption C:\n```\n0 1 0 1\n0 1 1 0\n1 0 0 0\n1 0 0 1\n```\n\nLet's check rows:\n\nRow 1: 0,1,0,1. Good.\nRow 2: 0,1,1,0. Good.\nRow 3: 1,0,0,0. Oh, here we have three 0s at the end. That's not allowed because we can't have more than two consecutive identical numbers. So this row is invalid. Therefore, Option C is incorrect.\n\nOption D:\n```\n0 1 0 1\n0 1 1 0\n1 0 1 0\n1 0 0 0\n```\n\nChecking rows:\n\nRow 1: 0,1,0,1. Good.\nRow 2: 0,1,1,0. Good.\nRow 3: 1,0,1,0. Good.\nRow 4: 1,0,0,0. Again, three 0s at the end. So this row is invalid. So Option D is out.\n\nSo, from the options, only Option A satisfies all the rules. Let me just double-check for any possible mistakes.\n\nLooking back at Option A's rows and columns, I didn't spot any issues. Each row and column has exactly two 0s and two 1s, no more than two consecutive same numbers, and all rows and columns are unique.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer must be Option A.\n</think>\n\nThe correct answer is Option A, as it satisfies all the Binairo rules without any violations.\n\n\\boxed{A}", "ground_truth": "A", "prompt": "You need to solve a Binairo puzzle (Size: 4x4).You need to solve a Binairo puzzle.\n\n**Binairo Puzzle Rules:**\n1.

{"question_id": "binairo_842", "response": "Alright, so I need to solve this 4x4 Binairo puzzle. There are four options given, and I need to check each one to see which one fits all the rules. Let me go through each rule and see how it applies to each option.\n\nFirst, let me recall the rules:\n\n1. Each cell must be 0 or 1. So, no other numbers, just 0s and 1s. All options seem to satisfy this because they only have 0s and 1s.\n\n2. No more than two consecutive identical numbers in any row or column. So, no three 0s or three 1s in a row or column. I need to check each row and column for this.\n\n3. Each row and column must have an equal number of 0s and 1s. Since it's a 4x4 grid, each row and column must have exactly two 0s and two 1s.\n\n4. No two rows can be identical, and no two columns can be identical. So, all four rows must be unique, and all four columns must be unique.\n\nAlright, let me start by checking each option one by one.\n\n**Option A:**\n\nThe grid is:\n\n1 1 0 0\n\n0 1 1 0\n\n1 0 0 1\n\n0 0 1 1\n\nLet me check each row first.\n\nRow 1: 1,1,0,0. Are there more than two consecutive identical? Yes, the first two are 1s, that's two, which is allowed. Then two 0s, which is also allowed. So row 1 is okay.\n\nRow 2: 0,1,1,0. There are two 1s in the middle, that's allowed. The rest are single 0s and 1s, so okay.\n\nRow 3: 1,0,0,1. Two 0s in the middle, allowed. The rest are single, so okay.\n\nRow 4: 0,0,1,1. Two 0s and two 1s, each pair. So all rows are okay.\n\nNow, columns:\n\nColumn 1: 1,0,1,0. Alternating, so no more than two same in a row. Good.\n\nColumn 2: 1,1,0,0. Two 1s followed by two 0s. Allowed.\n\nColumn 3: 0,1,0,1. Alternating, good.\n\nColumn 4: 0,0,1,1. Two 0s and two 1s, each pair. Allowed.\n\nSo, the consecutive rule is satisfied.\n\nNow, check if each row has two 0s and two 1s.\n\nRow 1: two 1s, two 0s. Good.\n\nRow 2: two 1s, two 0s. Good.\n\nRow 3: two 0s, two 1s. Good.\n\nRow 4: two 0s, two 1s. Good.\n\nEach column:\n\nColumn 1: 1,0,1,0. Two 1s, two 0s.\n\nColumn 2: 1,1,0,0. Two 1s, two 0s.\n\nColumn 3: 0,1,0,1. Two 0s, two 1s.\n\nColumn 4: 0,0,1,1. Two 0s, two 1s.\n\nAll good.\n\nNow, check for identical rows. Let's see:\n\nRow 1: 1,1,0,0\n\nRow 2: 0,1,1,0\n\nRow 3: 1,0,0,1\n\nRow 4: 0,0,1,1\n\nAre any rows identical? Let's compare:\n\nRow 1 vs Row 2: different.\n\nRow 1 vs Row 3: different.\n\nRow 1 vs Row 4: different.\n\nRow 2 vs Row 3: different.\n\nRow 2 vs Row 4: different.\n\nRow 3 vs Row 4: different.\n\nSo, all rows are unique.\n\nNow, columns. Are any columns identical?\n\nColumn 1: 1,0,1,0\n\nColumn 2: 1,1,0,0\n\nColumn 3: 0,1,0,1\n\nColumn 4: 0,0,1,1\n\nLooking at these, all columns seem unique. For example:\n\nColumn 1 is 1,0,1,0\n\nColumn 2 is 1,1,0,0\n\nThey start with 1 but differ in the next elements, so not identical.\n\nSimilarly, Column 3 is 0,1,0,1\n\nColumn 4 is 0,0,1,1\n\nDifferent patterns. So columns are unique.\n\nSo, Option A seems to satisfy all rules. Hmm, but let me check the other options too because maybe I missed something.\n\n**Option B:**\n\nGrid:\n\n0 1 0 0\n\n0 1 1 0\n\n1 0 0 1\n\n0 0 1 1\n\nLet me check rows first.\n\nRow 1: 0,1,0,0. Last two 0s, allowed.\n\nRow 2: 0,1,1,0. Two 1s, allowed.\n\nRow 3: 1,0,0,1. Two 0s, allowed.\n\nRow 4: 0,0,1,1. Two 0s, two 1s. Okay.\n\nNow, columns:\n\nColumn 1: 0,0,1,0. First two 0s, allowed.\n\nColumn 2: 1,1,0,0. Two 1s, allowed.\n\nColumn 3: 0,1,0,1. Alternating, okay.\n\nColumn 4: 0,0,1,1. Allowed.\n\nNow, checking counts:\n\nEach row has two 0s and two 1s? Let's see.\n\nRow 1: 0,1,0,0: three 0s and one 1. Oh, wait! That's three 0s and one 1. That violates rule 3, which requires exactly two 0s and two 1s in each row. So, Option B is invalid. So I can eliminate B.\n\nBut let me check just to be thorough.\n\nRow 1: three 0s. So yes, violates the equal count. So B is out.\n\n**Option C:**\n\nGrid:\n\n1 1 0 0\n\n0 1 1 0\n\n1 0 1 1\n\n0 0 1 1\n\nChecking rows:\n\nRow 1: 1,1,0,0. Two 1s, two 0s. Okay.\n\nRow 2: 0,1,1,0. Two 1s, two 0s. Okay.\n\nRow 3: 1,0,1,1. Ends with two 1s. So, that's okay because it's only two.\n\nBut wait, in Row 3: 1,0,1,1. So, positions 3 and 4 are both 1s. That's two, allowed.\n\nRow 4: 0,0,1,1. Two 0s, two 1s. Okay.\n\nSo rows are okay.\n\nNow, columns:\n\nColumn 1: 1,0,1,0. Alternating, okay.\n\nColumn 2: 1,1,0,0. Two 1s, two 0s. Okay.\n\nColumn 3: 0,1,1,1. Wait, Column 3: 0,1,1,1. That's three 1s at the end. That's three in a row, which violates rule 2. So Column 3 has three consecutive 1s. So Option C is invalid.\n\nSo, C is out.\n\n**Option D:**\n\nGrid:\n\n1 1 0 0\n\n0 1 1 0\n\n1 0 0 1\n\n0 0 1 0\n\nChecking rows:\n\nRow 1: 1,1,0,0. Two 1s, two 0s. Okay.\n\nRow 2: 0,1,1,0. Two 1s, two 0s. Okay.\n\nRow 3: 1,0,0,1. Two 0s, two 1s. Okay.\n\nRow 4: 0,0,1,0. First two 0s, allowed. Then a 1 and a 0. So, only two 0s. But wait, let me check the count: 0,0,1,0. So that's three 0s and one 1. That violates rule 3, which requires two each. So, Option D is invalid because Row 4 has three 0s.\n\nWait, but let me double-check.\n\nRow 4: 0,0,1,0. So, three 0s? Yes, positions 1,2,4. So three 0s and one 1. So, violates the equal count. So D is out.\n\nSo, only Option A seems to satisfy all the rules. Let me just go back and make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nIn Option A:\n\n- Rows: All have two 0s and two 1s, no three in a row.\n\n- Columns: Each column has two 0s and two 1s, no three in a row.\n\n- All rows are unique.\n\n- All columns are unique.\n\nSo, yes, Option A is the correct solution.\n</think>\n\nThe correct answer is Option A because it satisfies all the Binairo rules without any violations.\n\n\\boxed{A}", "ground_truth": "A", "prompt": "You need to solve a Binairo puzzle (Size: 4x4).You need to solve a Binairo puzzle.\n\n**Binairo Puzzle Rules:**\n1.

{"question_id": "binairo_802", "response": "Okay, so I've got this Binairo puzzle to solve, and I need to figure out which of the four options (A, B, C, D) is the correct solution. Let me go through each rule step by step and check each option against them.\n\nFirst, let me recap the rules to make sure I don't miss anything:\n\n1. Each cell must be either 0 or 1. Well, looking at all options, each cell is either 0 or 1, so that's covered.\n\n2. No more than two consecutive identical numbers in any row or column. So, I need to check each row and column for any sequences of three 0s or 1s in a row.\n\n3. Each row and column must have an equal number of 0s and 1s. Since it's a 6x6 grid, each row and column should have exactly 3 zeros and 3 ones.\n\n4. No two rows can be identical, and no two columns can be identical. So, each row must be unique, and each column must also be unique.\n\nAlright, let's start by examining each option one by one.\n\n**Option A:**\n\nLet's first check the rows for consecutive numbers.\n\nRow 1: 1 0 1 0 0 1. I see a \"0 0\" at the end, which is two consecutive, that's okay. No three in a row, so good.\n\nRow 2: 0 0 1 1 0 1. Here, \"0 0\" and \"1 1\" are present, but no three, so okay.\n\nRow 3: 1 1 0 0 1 0. Again, \"1 1\" and \"0 0\", but no three, so okay.\n\nRow 4: 0 1 0 1 0 1. Alternating, no consecutive duplicates, so good.\n\nRow 5: 1 0 1 0 1 0. Same as above, alternating, so no issues.\n\nRow 6: 0 1 0 1 1 0. Here, at the end, \"1 1\", which is two, so acceptable.\n\nNow, let's check each row's count of 0s and 1s.\n\nRow 1: 1,0,1,0,0,1 → three 1s and three 0s? Let's count: 1 appears at positions 1,3,6 → three 1s. 0s at 2,4,5 → three 0s. Good.\n\nRow 2: 0,0,1,1,0,1 → zeros at 1,2,5 → three; ones at 3,4,6 → three. Good.\n\nRow 3: 1,1,0,0,1,0 → ones at 1,2,5; zeros at 3,4,6. Three each. Good.\n\nRow 4: 0,1,0,1,0,1 → three 0s and three 1s. Good.\n\nRow 5: 1,0,1,0,1,0 → same, three each.\n\nRow 6: 0,1,0,1,1,0 → zeros at 1,3,6; ones at 2,4,5. So three each. Good.\n\nNow, checking for unique rows. Let's see if any rows are duplicates.\n\nRows 1-6:\n\n1: 1 0 1 0 0 1\n\n2: 0 0 1 1 0 1\n\n3: 1 1 0 0 1 0\n\n4: 0 1 0 1 0 1\n\n5: 1 0 1 0 1 0\n\n6: 0 1 0 1 1 0\n\nLooking at these, I don't see any duplicates. Each row is unique. Good.\n\nNow, columns. Let's check each column for two consecutive same numbers.\n\nColumn 1:\n\nRow1:1\n\nRow2:0\n\nRow3:1\n\nRow4:0\n\nRow5:1\n\nRow6:0\n\nSo, 1,0,1,0,1,0. No three in a row, so good.\n\nColumn 2:\n\nRow1:0\n\nRow2:0\n\nRow3:1\n\nRow4:1\n\nRow5:0\n\nRow6:1\n\nSo, 0,0,1,1,0,1. Here, in the first two rows, two 0s, which is allowed, but not three. Similarly, rows 3-4 have two 1s. So, okay.\n\nColumn 3:\n\nRow1:1\n\nRow2:1\n\nRow3:0\n\nRow4:0\n\nRow5:1\n\nRow6:0\n\nSequence: 1,1,0,0,1,0. Again, two 1s and two 0s, but no three. Good.\n\nColumn 4:\n\nRow1:0\n\nRow2:1\n\nRow3:0\n\nRow4:1\n\nRow5:0\n\nRow6:1\n\nSo, 0,1,0,1,0,1. Alternating, so no consecutive duplicates. Good.\n\nColumn 5:\n\nRow1:0\n\nRow2:0\n\nRow3:1\n\nRow4:0\n\nRow5:1\n\nRow6:1\n\nSequence: 0,0,1,0,1,1. The first two are 0s, then 1, then 0, then 1s at the end. The last three are 1,1, but only two, so acceptable. No three in a row. Good.\n\nColumn 6:\n\nRow1:1\n\nRow2:1\n\nRow3:0\n\nRow4:1\n\nRow5:0\n\nRow6:0\n\nSequence: 1,1,0,1,0,0. Again, two 1s, then 0, then 1, then two 0s. No three in a row. Good.\n\nNow, check if each column has three 0s and three 1s.\n\nColumn1: 1,0,1,0,1,0 → three 1s, three 0s.\n\nColumn2: 0,0,1,1,0,1 → three 0s (positions1,2,5), three 1s (3,4,6).\n\nColumn3: 1,1,0,0,1,0 → three 1s, three 0s.\n\nColumn4: 0,1,0,1,0,1 → three each.\n\nColumn5: 0,0,1,0,1,1 → three 0s (1,2,4), three 1s (3,5,6).\n\nColumn6:1,1,0,1,0,0 → three 1s (1,2,4), three 0s (3,5,6).\n\nSo, all columns have equal numbers. Good.\n\nNow, check for unique columns. Are any columns identical?\n\nLooking at columns:\n\nColumn1: 1,0,1,0,1,0\n\nColumn2: 0,0,1,1,0,1\n\nColumn3:1,1,0,0,1,0\n\nColumn4:0,1,0,1,0,1\n\nColumn5:0,0,1,0,1,1\n\nColumn6:1,1,0,1,0,0\n\nLooking at these, each seems unique. None are duplicates. For example, Column1 is alternating, Column2 starts with two 0s, Column3 starts with two 1s, etc. So, no duplicates. Good.\n\nSo, Option A seems to satisfy all the rules. But let's check the other options just to be sure.\n\n**Option B:**\n\nFirst, let's check the rows for consecutive numbers.\n\nRow1:0 0 1 0 0 1. Here, the first two are 0s, then 1, then two 0s, then 1. So, no three in a row. Good.\n\nRow2:0 0 1 1 0 1. Two 0s, two 1s, etc. Good.\n\nRow3:1 1 0 0 1 0. Two 1s, two 0s. Good.\n\nRow4:0 1 0 1 0 1. Alternating, so no consecutive duplicates. Good.\n\nRow5:1 0 1 0 1 0. Same as above. Good.\n\nRow6:0 1 0 1 1 0. Two 1s at the end, so acceptable.\n\nNow, check row counts.\n\nRow1: 0,0,1,0,0,1 → zeros at 1,2,4,5 → four zeros. Oh, wait, that's a problem. Each row must have exactly three 0s and three 1s. Here, Row1 has four 0s and two 1s. So, this violates rule 3. So, Option B is invalid.\n\nBut wait, let me recount:\n\nRow1: 0,0,1,0,0,1.\n\nNumber of 0s: positions 1,2,4,5 → four 0s.\n\nNumber of 1s: positions 3,6 → two 1s.\n\nYes, that's four 0s and two 1s. So, invalid.\n\nTherefore, Option B is out.\n\n**Option C:**\n\nLet's check the rows for consecutive numbers.\n\nRow1:1 0 1 0 0 1. Two 0s at the end. Fine.\n\nRow2:0 0 1 1 0 1. Two 0s and two 1s. Fine.\n\nRow3:1 1 0 0 1 0. Two 1s and two 0s. Fine.\n\nRow4:0 1 0 0 0 1. Wait, here, positions 3,4,5 are 0s. So, three 0s in a row. That's a violation of rule 2. So, Option C is invalid.\n\nYes, in row4, after the 1, there are three 0s. So, that's not allowed. So, Option C is out.\n\n**Option D:**\n\nCheck rows for consecutive numbers.\n\nRow1:1 0 1 0 0 1. Two 0s. Fine.\n\nRow2:0 0 1 1 0 1. Two 0s, two 1s. Fine.\n\nRow3:1 1 0 0 1 0. Two 1s, two 0s. Fine.\n\nRow4:0 1 0 1 0 1. Alternating. Fine.\n\nRow5:1 0 1 0 1 0. Alternating. Fine.\n\nRow6:0 1 0 1 1 1. Wait, at the end, three 1s. So, in row6, positions 5,6,7? Wait, no, it's 0,1,0,1,1,1. So, the last three are 1,1,1. That's three in a row. Violates rule 2. So, Option D is invalid.\n\nSo, only Option A passed all the checks.\n\nWait, but let me double-check Option A for columns. Maybe I missed something.\n\nLooking back at Option A's columns.\n\nColumn5: 0,0,1,0,1,1.\n\nSo, positions 1,2: 0,0; then 3:1; 4:0; 5:1; 6:1.\n\nSo, in positions 5,6: 1,1. Only two, so okay.\n\nSimilarly, Column6:1,1,0,1,0,0.\n\nPositions 1,2:1,1; then 3:0; 4:1; 5,6:0,0. So, two each, acceptable.\n\nAlso, checking for unique columns: I think earlier I concluded they are unique, but let me confirm.\n\nColumn1: 1,0,1,0,1,0.\n\nColumn2:0,0,1,1,0,1.\n\nColumn3:1,1,0,0,1,0.\n\nColumn4:0,1,0,1,0,1.\n\nColumn5:0,0,1,0,1,1.\n\nColumn6:1,1,0,1,0,0.\n\nEach column is unique because their patterns are different.\n\nSo, yes, Option A satisfies all the rules.\n\nWait, but let me check the counts again for each row and column in Option A.\n\nRow1: 1,0,1,0,0,1 → 3 ones, 3 zeros.\n\nRow2:0,0,1,1,0,1 → 3 ones, 3 zeros.\n\nRow3:1,1,0,0,1,0 → same.\n\nRow4:0,1,0,1,0,1 → same.\n\nRow5:1,0,1,0,1,0 → same.\n\nRow6:0,1,0,1,1,0 → same.\n\nColumns:\n\nColumn1:1,0,1,0,1,0 → 3 ones, 3 zeros.\n\nColumn2:0,0,1,1,0,1 → same.\n\nColumn3:1,1,0,0,1,0 → same.\n\nColumn4:0,1,0,1,0,1 → same.\n\nColumn5:0,0,1,0,1,1 → same.\n\nColumn6:1,1,0,1,0,0 → same.\n\nAll good.\n\nAnd no duplicates in rows or columns.

{"question_id": "binairo_1024", "response": "Alright, so I've got this Binairo puzzle to solve, and I need to figure out which of the four options (A, B, C, D) is the correct one. Let me start by recalling the rules to make sure I don't miss anything.\n\nFirst off, each cell must be either 0 or 1. That's straightforward. The second rule says there can't be more than two consecutive identical numbers in any row or column. So, no three 0s or 1s in a row. The third rule is that each row and column must have an equal number of 0s and 1s. Since it's a 6x6 grid, that means exactly three 0s and three 1s per row and column. The fourth rule is that no two rows or columns can be identical. So, every row must be unique, and every column must be unique as well.\n\nNow, looking at the options, I need to check each one against these rules. Let me start by examining each option one by one.\n\nStarting with **Option A**:\n\n```\n0 1 1 0 0 1\n1 0 0 1 1 0\n0 0 1 0 1 1\n0 1 0 1 0 1\n1 0 1 1 0 0\n1 1 0 0 1 0\n```\n\nI'll go through each row and check for consecutive duplicates and the count of 0s and 1s.\n\nRow 1: 0 1 1 0 0 1\n- Consecutive 1s: two, which is okay.\n- Consecutive 0s: two, which is okay.\n- Count: three 0s and three 1s. Good.\n\nRow 2: 1 0 0 1 1 0\n- Consecutive 0s: two, okay.\n- Consecutive 1s: two, okay.\n- Count: three 0s and three 1s.\n\nRow 3: 0 0 1 0 1 1\n- Consecutive 0s: two, okay.\n- Consecutive 1s: two, okay.\n- Count: three 0s and three 1s.\n\nRow 4: 0 1 0 1 0 1\n- Alternating, so no more than two same in a row.\n- Count: three 0s and three 1s.\n\nRow 5: 1 0 1 1 0 0\n- Consecutive 1s: two, okay.\n- Consecutive 0s: two, okay.\n- Count: three 0s and three 1s.\n\nRow 6: 1 1 0 0 1 0\n- Consecutive 1s: two, okay.\n- Consecutive 0s: two, okay.\n- Count: three 0s and three 1s.\n\nSo, all rows in Option A satisfy the first three rules. Now, let's check if any rows are identical. Looking at each row:\n\nRow 1: 0 1 1 0 0 1\nRow 2: 1 0 0 1 1 0\nRow 3: 0 0 1 0 1 1\nRow 4: 0 1 0 1 0 1\nRow 5: 1 0 1 1 0 0\nRow 6: 1 1 0 0 1 0\n\nEach row seems unique. Now, check columns. Let's go column by column.\n\nColumn 1:\n0\n1\n0\n0\n1\n1\n- Counts: 0 appears 3 times, 1 appears 3 times. Good.\n- Consecutive duplicates: 0 appears twice (rows 3-4), 1 appears twice (rows 5-6). Both are okay.\n\nColumn 2:\n1\n0\n0\n1\n0\n1\n- Counts: 1 appears 3 times, 0 appears 3 times.\n- Consecutive duplicates: 0 appears twice (rows 3-4), 1 appears once, then 0, then 1. So no more than two in a row.\n\nColumn 3:\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n- Alternating, so no more than two same in a row.\n- Counts: 3 each.\n\nColumn 4:\n0\n1\n0\n1\n1\n0\n- Consecutive 1s at the end: two, okay.\n- Counts: 3 each.\n\nColumn 5:\n0\n1\n1\n0\n0\n1\n- Consecutive 1s: two, okay.\n- Consecutive 0s: two, okay.\n- Counts: 3 each.\n\nColumn 6:\n1\n0\n1\n1\n0\n0\n- Consecutive 1s: two (rows 4-5), okay.\n- Consecutive 0s: two (rows 6-?), wait, row 6 has 0 at the end, row 5 has 0. So rows 5-6: 0 and 0, which is two, okay. So counts: three each.\n\nSo columns are good. Now, check if any columns are identical.\n\nLooking at each column:\n\nColumn 1: 0,1,0,0,1,1\nColumn 2:1,0,0,1,0,1\nColumn 3:1,0,1,0,1,0\nColumn 4:0,1,0,1,1,0\nColumn 5:0,1,1,0,0,1\nColumn 6:1,0,1,1,0,0\n\nEach column seems unique. So Option A passes all the rules. Hmm, but let me check the other options just to be sure.\n\nMoving on to **Option B**:\n\n```\n1 1 1 0 0 1\n1 0 0 1 1 0\n0 0 1 0 1 1\n0 1 0 1 0 1\n1 0 1 1 0 0\n1 1 0 0 1 0\n```\n\nFirst, check rows.\n\nRow 1:1 1 1 0 0 1\n- Consecutive 1s: three, which violates rule 2. So Option B is invalid. I can eliminate B right away.\n\nMoving on to **Option C**:\n\n```\n0 1 1 0 0 1\n1 0 0 1 1 0\n0 0 1 0 1 1\n0 1 0 0 0 1\n1 0 1 1 0 0\n1 1 0 0 1 0\n```\n\nCheck rows first.\n\nRow 1: Same as Option A, so okay.\n\nRow 2: Same as Option A, okay.\n\nRow 3: Same as Option A, okay.\n\nRow 4:0 1 0 0 0 1\n- Consecutive 0s: three (positions 3-5). That's a problem because rule 2 says no more than two. So this row is invalid. So Option C is out.\n\nNow, **Option D**:\n\n```\n0 1 1 0 0 1\n1 0 0 1 1 0\n0 0 1 0 1 1\n0 1 0 1 0 1\n1 0 1 1 0 0\n1 1 0 0 1 1\n```\n\nCheck rows.\n\nRow 1: same as A, okay.\n\nRow 2: same as A, okay.\n\nRow 3: same as A, okay.\n\nRow 4: same as A, okay.\n\nRow 5: same as A, okay.\n\nRow 6:1 1 0 0 1 1\n- Consecutive 1s: two at the start, two at the end. So that's two sets of two, which is okay.\n- Count: three 0s and three 1s.\n\nSo rows are okay. Now, check for identical rows. All rows in D are unique, same as A.\n\nNow, check columns.\n\nColumn 1:\n0\n1\n0\n0\n1\n1\nSame as Option A, so counts and consecutive are okay.\n\nColumn 2:\n1\n0\n0\n1\n0\n1\nSame as A, okay.\n\nColumn 3:\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\nSame as A, okay.\n\nColumn 4:\n0\n1\n0\n1\n1\n0\nSame as A, okay.\n\nColumn 5:\n0\n1\n1\n0\n0\n1\nSame as A, okay.\n\nColumn 6:\n1\n0\n1\n1\n0\n1\nWait, let's look at Column 6:\n\nRow 1:1\nRow 2:0\nRow 3:1\nRow 4:1\nRow 5:0\nRow 6:1\n\nSo Column 6 is 1,0,1,1,0,1.\n\nCheck for consecutive duplicates: positions 3-4 are two 1s, okay. Also, counts: three 1s and three 0s? Let's see: 1 appears at rows 1,3,4,6: that's four 1s. Oh no, that's a problem. So in Column 6, there are four 1s and two 0s. That violates rule 3, which requires exactly three 0s and three 1s. So Option D is invalid.\n\nSo, Option D is out because Column 6 has four 1s.\n\nSo, going back, Option A is the only one that hasn't been eliminated. Let me just double-check Option A for any possible issues I might have missed.\n\nIn Option A, all rows have three 0s and three 1s, no more than two consecutive, and all rows are unique. Columns also have three each, no more than two consecutive, and all columns are unique.\n\nWait, let me double-check the columns in Option A.\n\nColumn 1: 0,1,0,0,1,1\n- Consecutive 0s: rows 3-4 (two), okay.\n- Consecutive 1s: rows 5-6 (two), okay.\n\nColumn 2:1,0,0,1,0,1\n- Consecutive 0s: rows 3-4 (two), okay.\n- 1s: no three in a row.\n\nColumn 3:1,0,1,0,1,0\n- Alternating, so no issues.\n\nColumn 4:0,1,0,1,1,0\n- Consecutive 1s at rows 5-6? Wait, no, row 5 is 1, row 6 is 0. Wait, let's look:\n\nRow 5, Column 4:1\nRow 6, Column 4:0\nSo actually, Column 4: 0,1,0,1,1,0\n- So the last two are 1 and 0, so only one 1 at the end. Wait, no, rows 4-5: 1 and 1, so that's two 1s. So, rows 4 and 5 have 1s. So consecutive 1s at rows 4-5, which is two, okay.\n\nColumn 5:0,1,1,0,0,1\n- Consecutive 1s at rows 2-3: two, okay.\n- Consecutive 0s at rows 5-6: two, okay.\n\nColumn 6:1,0,1,1,0,0\n- Consecutive 1s at rows 4-5: two, okay.\n- Consecutive 0s at rows 6-?: only two at the end, so okay.\n\nAll columns are fine. So Option A passes all the checks.\n\nI think that's solid. So the correct answer should be Option A.\n</think>\n\nThe correct answer is Option A, as it satisfies all the Binairo puzzle rules without any violations.\n\n\\boxed{A}", "ground_truth": "A", "prompt": "You need to solve a Binairo puzzle (Size: 6x6).You need to solve a Binairo puzzle.\n\n**Binairo Puzzle Rules:**\n1.

{"question_id": "binairo_123", "response": "Okay, so I've got this Binairo puzzle to solve, and I have four options to choose from: A, B, C, or D. I'm a bit new to these puzzles, but I'll try to think it through step by step.\n\nFirst, let me make sure I understand the rules correctly. The goal is to fill a 6x6 grid with 0s and 1s. The rules are:\n\n1. Each cell must be either 0 or 1.\n2. No more than two consecutive identical numbers in any row or column. So, no three in a row of the same number.\n3. Each row and column must have an equal number of 0s and 1s. Since it's a 6x6 grid, each row and column should have exactly three 0s and three 1s.\n4. No two rows can be identical, and no two columns can be identical.\n\nAlright, so with that in mind, I need to check each option against these rules.\n\nLet me start by examining Option A.\n\n**Option A:**\n\nRow 1: 0 0 1 1 0 1\nRow 2: 0 0 1 0 1 1\nRow 3: 1 1 0 1 0 0\nRow 4: 1 0 0 1 0 1\nRow 5: 0 1 1 0 1 0\nRow 6: 1 1 0 0 1 0\n\nFirst, let's check each row for consecutive numbers.\n\nRow 1: 0 0 (two 0s, okay), then 1 1 (two 1s, okay), then 0, 1. No three in a row, so rule 2 is satisfied here.\n\nRow 2: 0 0 (okay), 1, 0, 1 1 (two 1s, okay). Also satisfies rule 2.\n\nRow 3: 1 1 (okay), 0, 1, 0, 0 (two 0s, okay). Good.\n\nRow 4: 1, 0 0 (okay), 1, 0, 1. No three in a row. Good.\n\nRow 5: 0, 1 1 (okay), 0, 1, 0. Good.\n\nRow 6: 1 1 (okay), 0 0 (okay), 1, 0. Good.\n\nSo all rows satisfy rule 2.\n\nNow, check if each row has three 0s and three 1s.\n\nLet me count for each row:\n\nRow 1: 0,0,1,1,0,1 → three 0s and three 1s. Good.\n\nRow 2: 0,0,1,0,1,1 → three 0s, three 1s. Good.\n\nRow 3: 1,1,0,1,0,0 → three 0s, three 1s. Good.\n\nRow 4: 1,0,0,1,0,1 → three 0s, three 1s. Good.\n\nRow 5: 0,1,1,0,1,0 → three 0s, three 1s. Good.\n\nRow 6: 1,1,0,0,1,0 → three 0s, three 1s. Good.\n\nAll rows have the correct count. Now, check if any two rows are identical.\n\nLooking at the rows:\n\nRow 1: 0 0 1 1 0 1\nRow 2: 0 0 1 0 1 1\nRow 3: 1 1 0 1 0 0\nRow 4: 1 0 0 1 0 1\nRow 5: 0 1 1 0 1 0\nRow 6: 1 1 0 0 1 0\n\nI don't see any duplicates. Each row is unique.\n\nNow, check columns for two consecutive same numbers.\n\nLet me write down the columns:\n\nColumn 1:\nRow1:0\nRow2:0\nRow3:1\nRow4:1\nRow5:0\nRow6:1\n\nSo column 1: 0,0,1,1,0,1. There are two 0s at the top, then two 1s, then 0, then 1. No three in a row. Good.\n\nColumn 2:\nRow1:0\nRow2:0\nRow3:1\nRow4:0\nRow5:1\nRow6:1\n\nSequence: 0,0,1,0,1,1. Two 0s, then 1, 0, then two 1s. No three in a row. Good.\n\nColumn 3:\nRow1:1\nRow2:1\nRow3:0\nRow4:0\nRow5:1\nRow6:0\n\nSequence: 1,1,0,0,1,0. Two 1s, two 0s, then 1,0. Good.\n\nColumn 4:\nRow1:1\nRow2:0\nRow3:1\nRow4:1\nRow5:0\nRow6:0\n\nSequence:1,0,1,1,0,0. Two 1s at the end, rest are alternating. No three in a row. Good.\n\nColumn 5:\nRow1:0\nRow2:1\nRow3:0\nRow4:0\nRow5:1\nRow6:1\n\nSequence:0,1,0,0,1,1. Two 0s in the middle, two 1s at the end. Good.\n\nColumn 6:\nRow1:1\nRow2:1\nRow3:0\nRow4:1\nRow5:0\nRow6:0\n\nSequence:1,1,0,1,0,0. Two 1s, then 0,1,0,0. No three in a row. Good.\n\nSo all columns satisfy rule 2.\n\nNow, check if each column has three 0s and three 1s.\n\nLet's count each column:\n\nColumn 1: 0,0,1,1,0,1 → 3 zeros, 3 ones. Good.\n\nColumn 2: 0,0,1,0,1,1 → 3 zeros, 3 ones. Good.\n\nColumn 3:1,1,0,0,1,0 → 3 zeros, 3 ones. Good.\n\nColumn 4:1,0,1,1,0,0 → 3 zeros, 3 ones. Good.\n\nColumn 5:0,1,0,0,1,1 → 3 zeros, 3 ones. Good.\n\nColumn 6:1,1,0,1,0,0 → 3 zeros, 3 ones. Good.\n\nSo all columns have the correct count.\n\nNow, check if any two columns are identical.\n\nLooking at each column's sequence:\n\nColumn1: 0,0,1,1,0,1\nColumn2:0,0,1,0,1,1\nColumn3:1,1,0,0,1,0\nColumn4:1,0,1,1,0,0\nColumn5:0,1,0,0,1,1\nColumn6:1,1,0,1,0,0\n\nLooking at the sequences:\n\nColumn3 is 1,1,0,0,1,0\n\nColumn6 is 1,1,0,1,0,0\n\nThese are different because the fourth element in Column3 is 0, while in Column6 it's 1.\n\nSimilarly, check others:\n\nColumn1 and Column2 are different.\n\nColumn4: 1,0,1,1,0,0\n\nNo other column is the same. So all columns are unique.\n\nSo Option A seems to satisfy all the rules. But let me check the other options too, just to make sure.\n\n**Option B:**\n\nRow1:1 0 1 1 0 1\nRow2:0 0 1 0 1 1\nRow3:1 1 0 1 0 0\nRow4:1 0 0 1 0 1\nRow5:0 1 1 0 1 0\nRow6:1 1 0 0 1 0\n\nFirst, check rows for consecutive numbers.\n\nRow1:1,0,1,1,0,1. So 1,0,1,1,0,1. There's two 1s at positions 3 and 4, which is allowed. Then 0,1. Good.\n\nRow2:0,0,1,0,1,1. Two 0s, then 1,0,1,1. Good.\n\nRow3:1,1,0,1,0,0. Two 1s, then 0,1,0,0. Good.\n\nRow4:1,0,0,1,0,1. 0,0 is okay, then 1,0,1. Good.\n\nRow5:0,1,1,0,1,0. Two 1s, then 0,1,0. Good.\n\nRow6:1,1,0,0,1,0. Two 1s, two 0s, then 1,0. Good.\n\nSo all rows satisfy rule 2.\n\nNow, count 0s and 1s in each row.\n\nRow1:1,0,1,1,0,1 → four 1s and two 0s. Wait, that's not three each. So this violates rule 3. So Option B is invalid because Row1 has four 1s and two 0s. So I can eliminate Option B right away.\n\n**Option C:**\n\nRow1:0 0 1 1 0 1\nRow2:0 0 1 0 1 1\nRow3:1 1 0 1 0 0\nRow4:1 0 0 0 0 1\nRow5:0 1 1 0 1 0\nRow6:1 1 0 0 1 0\n\nFirst, check for consecutive numbers.\n\nRow1:0,0,1,1,0,1. Okay, two 0s, two 1s.\n\nRow2:0,0,1,0,1,1. Okay.\n\nRow3:1,1,0,1,0,0. Okay.\n\nRow4:1,0,0,0,0,1. Oh, wait! There are four 0s in a row here: 0,0,0,0. That's four consecutive 0s. That's definitely violating rule 2. So Option C is invalid because of this.\n\nSo I can eliminate Option C.\n\n**Option D:**\n\nRow1:0 0 1 1 0 1\nRow2:0 0 1 0 1 1\nRow3:1 1 0 1 0 0\nRow4:1 0 0 1 0 1\nRow5:0 1 1 0 1 0\nRow6:1 1 0 0 1 1\n\nFirst, check rows for consecutive numbers.\n\nRow1:0,0,1,1,0,1. Okay.\n\nRow2:0,0,1,0,1,1. Okay.\n\nRow3:1,1,0,1,0,0. Okay.\n\nRow4:1,0,0,1,0,1. Okay.\n\nRow5:0,1,1,0,1,0. Okay.\n\nRow6:1,1,0,0,1,1. Wait, at the end, there's 1,1. That's two, which is okay. Wait, but looking at Row6: 1,1,0,0,1,1. So from positions 5 and 6: 1,1. That's allowed. So no three in a row. So all rows are okay for rule 2.\n\nNow, check each row's count.\n\nRow1: 0,0,1,1,0,1 → three 0s, three 1s. Good.\n\nRow2: same as above. Good.\n\nRow3: same as above. Good.\n\nRow4: 1,0,0,1,0,1 → three 0s, three 1s. Good.\n\nRow5: same as Row1. Good.\n\nRow6:1,1,0,0,1,1 → three 0s and three 1s. Good.\n\nNow, check for identical rows.\n\nLooking at the rows:\n\nRow1:0 0 1 1 0 1\nRow2:0 0 1 0 1 1\nRow3:1 1 0 1 0 0\nRow4:1 0 0 1 0 1\nRow5:0 1 1 0 1 0\nRow6:1 1 0 0 1 1\n\nI don't see any identical rows. Each is unique.\n\nNow, check columns for consecutive numbers.\n\nLet me write down the columns:\n\nColumn1:\nRow1:0\nRow2:0\nRow3:1\nRow4:1\nRow5:0\nRow6:1\n\nSo sequence: 0,0,1,1,0,1. Two 0s, two 1s, 0,1. No three in a row. Good.\n\nColumn2:\nRow1:0\nRow2:0\nRow3:1\nRow4:0\nRow5:1\nRow6:1\n\nSequence: 0,0,1,0,1,1. Two 0s, then 1,0,1,1. Good.\n\nColumn3:\nRow1:1\nRow2:1\nRow3:0\nRow4:0\nRow5:1\nRow6:0\n\nSequence:1,1,0,0,1,0. Two 1s, two 0s, 1,0. Good.\n\nColumn4:\nRow1:1\nRow2:0\nRow3:1\nRow4:1\nRow5:0\nRow6:0\n\nSequence:1,0,1,1,0,0. Two 1s, then 0,0. Good.\n\nColumn5:\nRow1:0\nRow2:1\nRow3:0\nRow4:0\nRow5:1\nRow6:1\n\nSequence:0,1,0,0,1,1. Two 0s, then two 1s. Good.\n\nColumn6:\nRow1:1\nRow2:1\nRow3:0\nRow4:1\nRow5:0\nRow6:1\n\nSequence:1,1,0,1,0,1. Two 1s, then 0,1,0,1. Good.\n\nSo all columns satisfy rule 2.\n\nNow, check if each column has three 0s and three 1s.\n\nCount for each column:\n\nColumn1:0,0,1,1,0,1 → three 0s, three 1s. Good.\n\nColumn2:0,0,1,0,1,1 → three 0s, three 1s. Good.\n\nColumn3:1,1,0,0,1,0 → three 0s, three 1s. Good.\n\nColumn4:1,0,1,1,0,0 → three 0s, three 1s. Good.\n\nColumn5:0,1,0,0,1,1 → three 0s, three 1s. Good.\n\nColumn6:1,1,0,1,0,1 → three 0s, three 1s. Good.\n\nAll columns have the correct count.\n\nNow, check if any two columns are identical.\n\nLooking at each column's sequence:\n\nColumn1:0,0,1,1,0,1\nColumn2:0,0,1,0,1,1\nColumn3:1,1,0,0,1,0\nColumn4:1,0,1,1,0,0\nColumn5:0,1,0,0,1,1\nColumn6:1,1,0,1,0,1\n\nCompare them:\n\nColumn3:1,1,0,0,1,0\nColumn6:1,1,0,1,0,1\n\nThese are different because positions 4 and 5 are 0,1 in Column3 vs 1,0 in Column6.\n\nSimilarly, others don't seem identical. So all columns are unique.\n\nSo both Options A and D satisfy all the rules. Wait, but the user said that there is a correct answer, and I have to choose one. Hmm.\n\nWait, let me check again. Maybe I missed something.\n\nWait, let's look at Option A's rows and Option D's rows.\n\nOption A's rows are:\n\nRow1:0 0 1 1 0 1\nRow2:0 0 1 0 1 1\nRow3:1 1 0 1 0 0\nRow4:1 0 0 1 0 1\nRow5:0 1 1 0 1 0\nRow6:1 1 0 0 1 0\n\nOption D's rows are:\n\nRow1:0 0 1 1 0 1\nRow2:0 0 1 0 1 1\nRow3:1 1 0 1 0 0\nRow4:1 0 0 1 0 1\nRow5:0 1 1 0 1 0\nRow6:1 1 0 0 1 1\n\nWait, looking at Row6 in Option D:1 1 0 0 1 1. So in the last two cells, it's 1,1. That's allowed, but let me check columns.\n\nWait, in Option D, Column6 is:\n\nRow1:1\nRow2:1\nRow3:0\nRow4:1\nRow5:0\nRow6:1\n\nSo Column6 in Option D: 1,1,0,1,0,1. Let's check for consecutive same numbers. It starts with two 1s, then 0,1,0,1. So no three in a row. Good.\n\nBut wait, let me check if any columns in D have identical sequences to any other column.\n\nWait, in Option D, Column1 is 0,0,1,1,0,1.\n\nColumn2 is 0,0,1,0,1,1.\n\nColumn3 is1,1,0,0,1,0.\n\nColumn4 is1,0,1,1,0,0.\n\nColumn5 is0,1,0,0,1,1.\n\nColumn6 is1,1,0,1,0,1.\n\nWait, Column6 in D is 1,1,0,1,0,1.\n\nCompare with Column3 in D:1,1,0,0,1,0. Different.\n\nIs any column repeated? Let's see:\n\nColumn1: 0,0,1,1,0,1\n\nColumn2:0,0,1,0,1,1\n\nColumn3:1,1,0,0,1,0\n\nColumn4:1,0,1,1,0,0\n\nColumn5:0,1,0,0,1,1\n\nColumn6:1,1,0,1,0,1\n\nI don't see any duplicates. So both A and D seem valid.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"There must exist a right answer, and you must choose one from them.\" So perhaps only one of A or D is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting somewhere.\n\nWait, let me check Option A's columns again. Let me check if any column in A is identical to another.\n\nLooking at Option A's columns:\n\nColumn1:0,0,1,1,0,1\n\nColumn2:0,0,1,0,1,1\n\nColumn3:1,1,0,0,1,0\n\nColumn4:1,0,1,1,0,0\n\nColumn5:0,1,0,0,1,1\n\nColumn6:1,1,0,1,0,0\n\nWait, Column3 in A:1,1,0,0,1,0\n\nColumn6 in A:1,1,0,1,0,0\n\nThese are different because in Column3, the fifth element is 1, while in Column6, it's 0. So they're different.\n\nNow, looking at Option D's columns, as I did earlier, none are duplicates.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake in considering the rows.\n\nWait, in Option A, Row6 is1 1 0 0 1 0.\n\nIn Option D, Row6 is1 1 0 0 1 1.\n\nSo in Option A, Row6 ends with 0, while in D, it ends with 1.\n\nWait, but let me check if Option A's Row6 has three 1s and three 0s: yes, 1,1,0,0,1,0 → three 1s and three 0s.\n\nSimilarly, in Option D, Row6:1,1,0,0,1,1 → three 1s and three 0s.\n\nWait, but maybe there's another rule I'm missing. The problem says \"no two rows can be identical, and no two columns can be identical.\"\n\nWait, in Option A, let's check if any two rows are the same.\n\nRow1:0 0 1 1 0 1\n\nRow2:0 0 1 0 1 1\n\nThese are different.\n\nRow3:1 1 0 1 0 0\n\nRow4:1 0 0 1 0 1\n\nDifferent.\n\nRow5:0 1 1 0 1 0\n\nRow6:1 1 0 0 1 0\n\nAll unique.\n\nSame for Option D.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should check if either Option A or D has any other issues.\n\nWait, in Option A, let's check Column6:1,1,0,1,0,0.\n\nSo in Column6, the sequence is 1,1,0,1,0,0.\n\nSo in the first two positions, it's 1,1, which is allowed. Then 0,1,0,0. So no three in a row. Good.\n\nIn Option D, Column6 is1,1,0,1,0,1. So two 1s, then 0,1,0,1. Also good.\n\nWait, maybe I should check for any other rule violations, like the number of 0s and 1s in columns.\n\nWait, both options satisfy that.\n\nHmm. Maybe I made a mistake earlier in evaluating Option D. Wait, let me check Option D's Row6 again.\n\nOption D's Row6:1 1 0 0 1 1\n\nSo the sequence is 1,1,0,0,1,1.\n\nSo in the first two cells, 1,1; then 0,0; then 1,1.\n\nSo that's allowed, as no three in a row. But wait, does the entire row have exactly three 1s and three 0s?\n\nYes: 1,1,0,0,1,1 → three 1s and three 0s.\n\nWait, but in Column6 of Option D, the last cell is 1, which makes the column:1,1,0,1,0,1.\n\nSo three 1s and three 0s, correct.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for other possibilities. Let me check if any of the options have duplicate columns.\n\nIn Option A, let's see the columns:\n\nColumn1:0,0,1,1,0,1\n\nColumn2:0,0,1,0,1,1\n\nColumn3:1,1,0,0,1,0\n\nColumn4:1,0,1,1,0,0\n\nColumn5:0,1,0,0,1,1\n\nColumn6:1,1,0,1,0,0\n\nNone of these look the same.\n\nIn Option D:\n\nColumn1:0,0,1,1,0,1\n\nColumn2:0,0,1,0,1,1\n\nColumn3:1,1,0,0,1,0\n\nColumn4:1,0,1,1,0,0\n\nColumn5:0,1,0,0,1,1\n\nColumn6:1,1,0,1,0,1\n\nAgain, none of these are duplicates.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check if any of the options have a column that is a shifted version of another, but I don't think that's a rule. The rule is that no two columns can be identical. So if they are different, that's okay.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed that in Option A, Column4:1,0,1,1,0,0.\n\nWait, let me check if any other column is the same as Column4.\n\nLooking at the other columns in Option A, none of them are the same as Column4.\n\nSimilarly, in Option D, Column4:1,0,1,1,0,0. None of the other columns in D are the same.\n\nHmm. Wait, perhaps I should look at the columns more carefully. Let me see.\n\nIn Option A, Column3:1,1,0,0,1,0.\n\nIn Option D, Column3:1,1,0,0,1,0.\n\nWait, that's the same as Option A's Column3. But wait, no, in Option D, Column3 is same as Option A's Column3.\n\nWait, no, let me check.\n\nWait, in Option A, Column3 is:\n\nRow1:1\n\nRow2:1\n\nRow3:0\n\nRow4:0\n\nRow5:1\n\nRow6:0\n\nSo sequence:1,1,0,0,1,0.\n\nIn Option D, Column3 is same as in A.\n\nWait, but in Option D, Column3 is same as in Option A. But in D, Row6 is different. So wait, no, in Option D, Column3 is same as in A. So that would mean that in Option D, Column3 is same as in A. But that's not possible because each column in the same option should be unique. Wait, no, within each option, the columns are unique. So in Option D, all columns are unique.\n\nWait, but in Option A, Column3 is same as in Option D's Column3, but that's irrelevant because we're considering each option separately.\n\nWait, but I'm trying to find which option is correct. So perhaps both A and D are correct, but that can't be. The problem says \"There must exist a right answer, and you must choose one from them.\"\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating Option A's columns. Let me check if any column in Option A is same as another.\n\nLooking at Option A's columns:\n\nColumn1:0,0,1,1,0,1\n\nColumn2:0,0,1,0,1,1\n\nColumn3:1,1,0,0,1,0\n\nColumn4:1,0,1,1,0,0\n\nColumn5:0,1,0,0,1,1\n\nColumn6:1,1,0,1,0,0\n\nAre any of these columns identical?\n\nCompare Column3 and Column6:\n\nColumn3:1,1,0,0,1,0\n\nColumn6:1,1,0,1,0,0\n\nThey are different because in position 4, Column3 has 0, while Column6 has 1.\n\nSimilarly, other columns don't match.\n\nSo both A and D satisfy all the rules, which is confusing because the problem says there is a correct answer. Maybe I need to look for something else.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check if any of the options have duplicate rows across different options, but that's not relevant. Each option is a separate puzzle.\n\nWait, maybe I should check for the exact number of 1s and 0s in each row and column again.\n\nWait, in Option A, let me check Row6 again:1,1,0,0,1,0. That's three 1s and three 0s. Good.\n\nIn Option D, Row6:1,1,0,0,1,1. Wait, that's four 1s and two 0s. Wait, no, 1,1,0,0,1,1: that's four 1s (positions 1,2,5,6) and two 0s. Wait, that's not three each. So that's a problem.\n\nWait, no, 1,1,0,0,1,1: 1,1 is two 1s, then 0,0, then 1,1: that's two more 1s. So total four 1s and two 0s. So that's a violation of rule 3. So Option D's Row6 is invalid. So I must have made a mistake earlier when evaluating Option D.\n\nWait, yes! I think I made a mistake in counting the 1s and 0s in Option D's Row6.\n\nOption D's Row6:1,1,0,0,1,1.\n\nSo positions 1:1, 2:1, 3:0, 4:0, 5:1, 6:1.\n\nSo 1s are at positions 1,2,5,6: four 1s. 0s at 3,4: two 0s. So that's four 1s and two 0s, which violates rule 3.\n\nSo Option D is invalid because of Row6.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was three 1s. I must have miscounted.\n\nSo that means Option D is invalid because Row6 has four 1s and two 0s. So the correct answer is Option A.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Option D's Row6:1,1,0,0,1,1. So 1,1,0,0,1,1. So 1 appears four times, 0 appears twice. So yes, it's invalid.\n\nTherefore, Option A is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe correct answer is Option A, as it satisfies all the rules of the Binairo puzzle without any violations.\n\n**Answer:**\n\\boxed{A}", "ground_truth": "A", "prompt": "You need to solve a Binairo puzzle (Size: 6x6).You need to solve a Binairo puzzle.\n\n**Binairo Puzzle Rules:**\n1.

{"question_id": "binairo_1202", "response": "Okay, I need to solve this Binairo puzzle and figure out which of the given options (A, B, C, D) is correct. Let me start by recalling the rules to make sure I don't miss anything.\n\nFirst, each cell must be either 0 or 1. Second, no more than two consecutive identical numbers in any row or column. So, no three in a row, like 000 or 111. Third, each row and column must have an equal number of 0s and 1s. Since it's a 6x6 grid, each row and column should have exactly three 0s and three 1s. Fourth, no two rows or columns can be identical.\n\nLet me go through each option one by one and check these conditions.\n\nStarting with Option A:\n\nOption A's grid is:\n1 1 0 1 0 0\n1 1 0 0 1 0\n0 0 1 0 1 1\n0 1 0 1 0 1\n1 0 1 0 1 0\n0 0 1 1 0 1\n\nFirst, let me check the consecutive numbers. I'll go row by row.\n\nRow 1: 1 1 0 1 0 0\n- The first two are 1s, which is allowed. Then 0, then 1, then 0, then 0. Wait, the last two are 0s. So that's two consecutive 0s, which is okay because it's exactly two. So row 1 is fine.\n\nRow 2: 1 1 0 0 1 0\n- Starts with two 1s, then two 0s. That's okay. Then 1, 0. So no three in a row anywhere. Good.\n\nRow 3: 0 0 1 0 1 1\n- First two 0s, okay. Then 1, then 0, then two 1s. Two consecutive 1s at the end. That's okay. So no issues here.\n\nRow 4: 0 1 0 1 0 1\n- Alternating 0 and 1. No consecutive duplicates. Perfect.\n\nRow 5: 1 0 1 0 1 0\n- Also alternating, so no issues.\n\nRow 6: 0 0 1 1 0 1\n- First two 0s, then two 1s. That's okay. Then 0, 1. So no three in a row. Good.\n\nNow, check each row for equal 0s and 1s.\n\nRow 1: 1,1,0,1,0,0 → 1s: 3, 0s: 3. Good.\n\nRow 2: 1,1,0,0,1,0 → 1s: 3, 0s: 3. Good.\n\nRow 3: 0,0,1,0,1,1 → 1s: 3, 0s: 3. Good.\n\nRow 4: 0,1,0,1,0,1 → 3 each. Good.\n\nRow 5: 1,0,1,0,1,0 → 3 each. Good.\n\nRow 6: 0,0,1,1,0,1 → 0s: 3, 1s: 3. Good.\n\nNow, check columns. Let me go column by column.\n\nColumn 1:\n1\n1\n0\n0\n1\n0\nSo, 1s: 1,1,0,0,1,0 → count of 1s: 3 (positions 1,2,5). 0s: 3 (positions 3,4,6). Good.\n\nColumn 2:\n1\n1\n0\n1\n0\n0\n1s: 3 (positions 1,2,4). 0s: 3 (positions 3,5,6). Good.\n\nColumn 3:\n0\n0\n1\n0\n1\n1\n1s: 3 (positions 3,5,6). 0s: 3 (positions 1,2,4). Good.\n\nColumn 4:\n1\n0\n0\n1\n0\n1\n1s: 3 (positions 1,4,6). 0s: 3 (positions 2,3,5). Good.\n\nColumn 5:\n0\n1\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1s: 3 (positions 2,3,5). 0s: 3 (positions 1,4,6). Good.\n\nColumn 6:\n0\n0\n1\n1\n0\n1\n1s: 3 (positions 3,4,6). 0s: 3 (positions 1,2,5). Good.\n\nNow, check if any rows are identical. Looking at the rows:\n\nRow 1: 1 1 0 1 0 0\nRow 2: 1 1 0 0 1 0\nRow 3: 0 0 1 0 1 1\nRow 4: 0 1 0 1 0 1\nRow 5: 1 0 1 0 1 0\nRow 6: 0 0 1 1 0 1\n\nEach row seems unique. Let me check:\n\nRow 1 vs others: No duplicates.\nRow 2 is unique.\nRow 3 is unique.\nRow 4 is unique.\nRow 5 is unique.\nRow 6 is unique.\n\nNow, check columns for uniqueness. Let's list each column as a string:\n\nColumn 1: 1,1,0,0,1,0 → \"110010\"\nColumn 2: 1,1,0,1,0,0 → \"110100\"\nColumn 3: 0,0,1,0,1,1 → \"001011\"\nColumn 4: 1,0,0,1,0,1 → \"100101\"\nColumn 5: 0,1,1,0,1,0 → \"011010\"\nColumn 6: 0,0,1,1,0,1 → \"001101\"\n\nAre any of these columns identical? Let's see:\n\n- Column 1: 110010\n- Column 2: 110100\n- Column 3: 001011\n- Column 4: 100101\n- Column 5: 011010\n- Column 6: 001101\n\nLooking at them, none of them repeat. So columns are all unique.\n\nSo Option A passes all the rules.\n\nWait, but I should check the other options too because sometimes more than one might pass. Let me check Option B.\n\nOption B:\n\n0 1 0 1 0 0\n1 1 0 0 1 0\n0 0 1 0 1 1\n0 1 0 1 0 1\n1 0 1 0 1 0\n0 0 1 1 0 1\n\nFirst, check for consecutive duplicates.\n\nRow 1: 0,1,0,1,0,0 → ends with two 0s. That's allowed. No three in a row anywhere. Good.\n\nRow 2: 1,1,0,0,1,0 → two 1s, two 0s, okay. Good.\n\nRow 3: 0,0,1,0,1,1 → two 0s, two 1s at the end. Good.\n\nRow 4: 0,1,0,1,0,1 → alternating, no duplicates. Good.\n\nRow 5: 1,0,1,0,1,0 → alternating. Good.\n\nRow 6: 0,0,1,1,0,1 → two 0s, two 1s. Good.\n\nNow, check counts in each row.\n\nRow 1: 0,1,0,1,0,0 → 0s: 4, 1s: 2. Oh wait, that's not equal. Each row should have 3 of each. So this is invalid. Therefore, Option B is invalid because Row 1 has four 0s and two 1s.\n\nSo I can eliminate Option B.\n\nMoving on to Option C:\n\nOption C's grid:\n\n1 1 0 1 0 0\n1 1 0 0 1 0\n0 0 1 0 1 1\n0 1 0 0 0 1\n1 0 1 0 1 0\n0 0 1 1 0 1\n\nLet's check for consecutive duplicates first.\n\nRow 1: 1,1,0,1,0,0 → two 1s, then two 0s. Fine.\n\nRow 2: 1,1,0,0,1,0 → two 1s, two 0s. Fine.\n\nRow 3: 0,0,1,0,1,1 → two 0s, two 1s. Fine.\n\nRow 4: 0,1,0,0,0,1 → Wait, there's a run of three 0s in the middle: 0,0,0. That's three in a row, which violates rule 2. So Row 4 is invalid. Therefore, Option C is invalid.\n\nNow, Option D:\n\nOption D's grid:\n\n1 1 0 1 0 0\n1 1 0 0 1 0\n0 0 1 0 1 1\n0 1 0 1 0 1\n1 0 1 0 1 0\n0 0 1 1 0 0\n\nFirst, check consecutive duplicates.\n\nRow 1: 1,1,0,1,0,0 → two 1s, two 0s. Good.\n\nRow 2: 1,1,0,0,1,0 → two 1s, two 0s. Good.\n\nRow 3: 0,0,1,0,1,1 → two 0s, two 1s. Good.\n\nRow 4: 0,1,0,1,0,1 → alternating. Good.\n\nRow 5: 1,0,1,0,1,0 → alternating. Good.\n\nRow 6: 0,0,1,1,0,0 → two 0s, two 1s, then two 0s. So two consecutive 0s at the end. Wait, no, it's 0,0,1,1,0,0. So the last two are 0s, but the first two are also 0s. But in the same row, are there three in a row? Let me check: 0,0, then 1,1, then 0,0. No three in a row. So Row 6 is fine.\n\nNow, check counts in each row.\n\nRow 1: 1,1,0,1,0,0 → 1s: 3, 0s:3. Good.\n\nRow 2: 1,1,0,0,1,0 → 1s:3, 0s:3. Good.\n\nRow 3: 0,0,1,0,1,1 → 1s:3, 0s:3. Good.\n\nRow 4: 0,1,0,1,0,1 → 3 each. Good.\n\nRow 5: 1,0,1,0,1,0 → 3 each. Good.\n\nRow 6: 0,0,1,1,0,0 → 0s: 4, 1s:2. Oh no, that's unequal. So Row 6 has four 0s and two 1s. That violates rule 3. So Option D is invalid.\n\nWait, let me recount Row 6 of Option D:\n\n0,0,1,1,0,0 → 0 appears at positions 1,2,5,6. So that's four 0s, and 1s at 3 and 4. So yes, 4 and 2. So invalid.\n\nSo Option D is out.\n\nSo the only valid option is Option A. But wait, I should double-check because sometimes I might have missed something.\n\nWait, looking back at Option A, I think I should check the columns again for uniqueness and equal counts, but I think I did that earlier.\n\nWait, also, I need to check if any columns have three in a row. Let me check each column for Option A.\n\nColumn 1: 1,1,0,0,1,0 → No three in a row. 1,1 is two, then 0,0 is two, then 1,0. So okay.\n\nColumn 2: 1,1,0,1,0,0 → same as above. 1,1, then 0, then 1, then 0,0. No three in a row.\n\nColumn 3: 0,0,1,0,1,1 → two 0s, then 1, then 0, then two 1s. No three in a row.\n\nColumn 4: 1,0,0,1,0,1 → alternates with two 0s, but no three in a row.\n\nColumn 5: 0,1,1,0,1,0 → two 1s, then 0, then 1, then 0. So two 1s, no three.\n\nColumn 6: 0,0,1,1,0,1 → two 0s, two 1s, then 0,1. No three in a row.\n\nSo all columns are good.\n\nAlso, all rows and columns are unique, as checked earlier.\n\nSo yes, Option A is the correct solution.\n</think>\n\nThe correct answer is determined by evaluating each option against the Binairo rules.

{"question_id": "binairo_1297", "response": "Okay, I need to solve this Binairo puzzle. Let me first make sure I understand the rules correctly.\n\nSo, Binairo is a 4x4 grid where each cell must be either 0 or 1. The rules are:\n1. Each cell is 0 or 1.\n2. No more than two consecutive identical numbers in any row or column. So, sequences like 000 or 111 are not allowed.\n3. Each row and column must have an equal number of 0s and 1s. Since it's a 4x4 grid, each row and column must have exactly two 0s and two 1s.\n4. No two rows can be identical, and no two columns can be identical either.\n\nThe options given are A, B, C, D, each with a 4x4 grid. I need to check which one satisfies all the rules.\n\nLet me go through each option one by one.\n\nStarting with Option A:\n```\n0 1 1 0\n0 1 0 1\n1 0 1 0\n1 0 0 1\n```\n\nFirst, checking for consecutive duplicates. Let's look at each row:\n\nRow 1: 0,1,1,0. There are two 1s in a row, which is allowed because the rule says no more than two. So that's okay.\n\nRow 2: 0,1,0,1. No consecutive duplicates at all. Good.\n\nRow 3: 1,0,1,0. Similarly, no consecutive duplicates. Perfect.\n\nRow 4: 1,0,0,1. Here, the two 0s are consecutive. That's allowed since it's exactly two, so that's fine.\n\nNow, checking columns. Let's look at each column:\n\nColumn 1: 0,0,1,1. There are two 0s followed by two 1s. No three in a row, so okay.\n\nColumn 2: 1,1,0,0. Similarly, two 1s then two 0s. That's fine.\n\nColumn 3: 1,0,1,0. Alternating, no consecutive duplicates. Good.\n\nColumn 4: 0,1,0,1. Also alternating, no issues.\n\nNext, each row and column must have exactly two 0s and two 1s. Let's verify:\n\nRow 1: 0,1,1,0 → two 0s and two 1s. Good.\n\nRow 2: 0,1,0,1 → same.\n\nRow 3: 1,0,1,0 → same.\n\nRow 4: 1,0,0,1 → same.\n\nColumns:\n\nColumn 1: 0,0,1,1 → two 0s and two 1s. Good.\n\nColumn 2: 1,1,0,0 → same.\n\nColumn 3: 1,0,1,0 → same.\n\nColumn 4: 0,1,0,1 → same.\n\nNow, check if any rows are identical. Let's see:\n\nRow 1: 0 1 1 0\n\nRow 2: 0 1 0 1\n\nRow 3: 1 0 1 0\n\nRow 4: 1 0 0 1\n\nAll rows are different. Good.\n\nColumns:\n\nColumn 1: 0,0,1,1 → unique.\n\nColumn 2: 1,1,0,0 → unique.\n\nColumn 3: 1,0,1,0 → unique.\n\nColumn 4: 0,1,0,1 → unique.\n\nSo, Option A seems to satisfy all the rules. But wait, let me check the other options just to be thorough, because sometimes there might be multiple correct options, but the problem says there is a right answer, so maybe I made a mistake.\n\nLooking at Option B:\n```\n1 1 1 0\n0 1 0 1\n1 0 1 0\n1 0 0 1\n```\n\nCheck rows first for consecutive duplicates.\n\nRow 1: 1,1,1,0. Oh, there are three 1s in a row. That's not allowed. So Option B is invalid because it violates rule 2.\n\nOption C:\n```\n0 1 1 0\n0 1 0 1\n1 0 0 0\n1 0 0 1\n```\n\nCheck rows:\n\nRow 1: 0,1,1,0 → okay.\n\nRow 2: 0,1,0,1 → okay.\n\nRow 3: 1,0,0,0 → three 0s at the end. That's invalid because three consecutive 0s. So Option C is out.\n\nOption D:\n```\n0 1 1 0\n0 1 0 1\n1 0 1 0\n1 0 0 0\n```\n\nCheck rows:\n\nRow 1: okay.\n\nRow 2: okay.\n\nRow 3: okay.\n\nRow 4: 1,0,0,0 → three 0s at the end. Invalid. So D is out.\n\nSo, only Option A satisfies all the rules. Therefore, the answer should be A.\n</think>\n\nThe correct answer is Option A because it adheres to all the rules of the Binairo puzzle without any violations.\n\n\\boxed{A}", "ground_truth": "A", "prompt": "You need to solve a Binairo puzzle (Size: 4x4).You need to solve a Binairo puzzle.\n\n**Binairo Puzzle Rules:**\n1.

{"question_id": "binairo_191", "response": "Okay, so I need to solve this Binairo puzzle. Let me first make sure I understand the rules correctly. \n\n1. Each cell is either 0 or 1.\n2. No more than two consecutive identical numbers in any row or column. So, three in a row is not allowed.\n3. Each row and column must have an equal number of 0s and 1s. Since it's a 6x6 grid, each row and column must have exactly 3 zeros and 3 ones.\n4. No two rows can be identical, and no two columns can be identical either.\n\nAlright, so the options are A, B, C, D. I need to check each one against these rules.\n\nLet me start by checking Option A:\n\nOption A:\n1 0 0 1 1 0  \n0 0 1 1 0 1  \n1 1 0 0 1 0  \n0 1 0 1 0 1  \n1 0 1 0 0 1  \n0 1 1 0 1 0  \n\nFirst, let's check for any three consecutive same numbers. Looking at each row:\n\nRow 1: 1 0 0 1 1 0. Let's see, the first three are 1,0,0 – no problem. Then 0,1,1 – that's two 1s, which is okay. Then 1,1,0 – again, two 1s. So no three in a row here.\n\nRow 2: 0 0 1 1 0 1. The first two are 0s, then 1s, then 0,1. No three same in a row.\n\nRow 3: 1 1 0 0 1 0. First two 1s, then two 0s, then 1,0. Fine.\n\nRow 4: 0 1 0 1 0 1. Alternating, so no issues.\n\nRow 5: 1 0 1 0 0 1. Alternating mostly, ends with two 0s, which is okay.\n\nRow 6: 0 1 1 0 1 0. Two 1s in the middle, okay.\n\nNow check columns:\n\nColumn 1: 1,0,1,0,1,0 – alternating, no three same.\n\nColumn 2: 0,0,1,1,0,1 – first two 0s, then two 1s, then 0,1. No problem.\n\nColumn 3: 0,1,0,0,1,1 – 0,1,0, then two 0s? Wait, row 4 column 3 is 0, row 5 column 3 is 1, row 6 column 3 is 1. So in column 3, from top to bottom: 0,1,0,0,1,1. So looking at that, are there three same in a row? Let's see: 0,1,0 – no. Then 0,0,1 – two 0s, okay. Then 1,1 – two 1s. So no three same.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me go through each column step by step.\n\nColumn 1: 1,0,1,0,1,0. No three same.\n\nColumn 2: 0,0,1,1,0,1. First two 0s, then two 1s. So no three same.\n\nColumn 3: 0,1,0,0,1,1. So starting from top: 0,1,0 – no. Then 0,0,1 – two 0s. Then 0,1,1 – two 1s. So no three same.\n\nColumn 4: 1,1,0,1,0,0. So 1,1 – two, then 0,1 – okay. Then 0,0 – two, so no three.\n\nColumn 5: 1,0,1,0,0,1. 1,0,1 – okay. Then 0,0,1 – two 0s.\n\nColumn 6: 0,1,0,1,1,0. 0,1,0 – okay. Then 1,1,0 – two 1s.\n\nSo for Option A, no row or column has three same in a row. Good.\n\nNext, check if each row has exactly three 0s and three 1s.\n\nRow 1: 1,0,0,1,1,0. Count 0s: 3. 1s: 3. Good.\n\nRow 2: 0,0,1,1,0,1. 0s: 3, 1s: 3. Good.\n\nRow 3: 1,1,0,0,1,0. 0s: 3, 1s: 3. Good.\n\nRow 4: 0,1,0,1,0,1. 0s: 3, 1s: 3. Good.\n\nRow 5: 1,0,1,0,0,1. 0s: 3, 1s: 3. Good.\n\nRow 6: 0,1,1,0,1,0. 0s: 3, 1s: 3. Good.\n\nColumns:\n\nColumn 1: 1,0,1,0,1,0. 0s:3, 1s:3.\n\nColumn 2: 0,0,1,1,0,1. 0s:3, 1s:3.\n\nColumn 3: 0,1,0,0,1,1. 0s:4, 1s:2. Wait, that's a problem. 0s are 4, 1s are 2. So this violates rule 3.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me recount column 3 for Option A.\n\nColumn 3: Row 1:0, Row2:1, Row3:0, Row4:0, Row5:1, Row6:1.\n\nSo 0s: rows 1,3,4: that's three 0s. 1s: rows 2,5,6: three 1s. So actually, it's 3 and 3. Maybe I miscounted earlier.\n\nWait, 0s: row1, row3, row4: three 0s. 1s: row2, row5, row6: three 1s. So column 3 is okay.\n\nWait, so perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me recount each column.\n\nColumn 1: 1,0,1,0,1,0. 0s:3, 1s:3.\n\nColumn 2: 0,0,1,1,0,1. 0s:3, 1s:3.\n\nColumn 3: 0,1,0,0,1,1. 0s: row1, row3, row4: 3. 1s: row2, row5, row6: 3.\n\nColumn4:1,1,0,1,0,0. 0s: row3, row5, row6:3. 1s: row1, row2, row4:3.\n\nColumn5:1,0,1,0,0,1. 0s: row2, row4, row5:3. 1s: row1, row3, row6:3.\n\nColumn6:0,1,0,1,1,0. 0s: row1, row3, row6:3. 1s: row2, row4, row5:3.\n\nSo all columns have 3 zeros and 3 ones. Good.\n\nNext, check if any two rows are identical. Let's compare rows.\n\nRow1:1 0 0 1 1 0  \nRow2:0 0 1 1 0 1  \nRow3:1 1 0 0 1 0  \nRow4:0 1 0 1 0 1  \nRow5:1 0 1 0 0 1  \nRow6:0 1 1 0 1 0  \n\nLooking for duplicates. Let's see:\n\nRow1 and Row5: different.\n\nRow2: unique.\n\nRow3: unique.\n\nRow4: unique.\n\nRow5: unique.\n\nRow6: unique.\n\nSo no two identical rows.\n\nColumns: check if any two columns are identical.\n\nLet me list the columns as column vectors:\n\nColumn1:1,0,1,0,1,0  \nColumn2:0,0,1,1,0,1  \nColumn3:0,1,0,0,1,1  \nColumn4:1,1,0,1,0,0  \nColumn5:1,0,1,0,0,1  \nColumn6:0,1,0,1,1,0  \n\nLooking for duplicates. Each column is unique. So no two columns are identical.\n\nSo Option A seems to satisfy all the rules. But let me check the other options just to be sure.\n\nOption B:\n\n0 0 0 1 1 0  \n0 0 1 1 0 1  \n1 1 0 0 1 0  \n0 1 0 1 0 1  \n1 0 1 0 0 1  \n0 1 1 0 1 0  \n\nFirst, check for three consecutive same numbers.\n\nRow1:0,0,0,1,1,0. Oh, wait, first three are 0s. That's three in a row. So this violates rule 2. So Option B is invalid. So we can eliminate B.\n\nOption C:\n\n1 0 0 1 1 0  \n0 0 1 1 0 1  \n1 1 0 0 1 0  \n0 1 0 0 0 1  \n1 0 1 0 0 1  \n0 1 1 0 1 0  \n\nCheck for three consecutive same numbers.\n\nRow1:1,0,0,1,1,0 – no issue.\n\nRow2:0,0,1,1,0,1 – first two 0s, okay.\n\nRow3:1,1,0,0,1,0 – two 1s, two 0s.\n\nRow4:0,1,0,0,0,1 – look at 0,0,0 in the middle. That's three 0s in a row. So row4 has three 0s consecutively. That's a violation. So Option C is invalid.\n\nOption D:\n\n1 0 0 1 1 0  \n0 0 1 1 0 1  \n1 1 0 0 1 0  \n0 1 0 1 0 1  \n1 0 1 0 0 1  \n0 1 1 0 1 1  \n\nCheck for three consecutive same numbers.\n\nRow1: fine.\n\nRow2: fine.\n\nRow3: fine.\n\nRow4: fine.\n\nRow5: fine.\n\nRow6: last three are 1,0,1. Wait, row6:0,1,1,0,1,1. So from position 4-6:0,1,1. That's two 1s, okay.\n\nWait, looking again. Let me check each row.\n\nRow6:0,1,1,0,1,1.\n\nWait, the last three are 1,1. Only two.\n\nBut wait, looking at the entire row: 0,1,1,0,1,1. Are there three in a row? The first two are 0,1; then 1,1; then 1,0; then 0,1; then 1,1. So no three same in a row.\n\nWait, but let's check column-wise.\n\nColumn5:1,0,1,0,0,1. Let me check each column for three in a row.\n\nWait, no, first check if any row or column has three same in a row.\n\nLooking at Option D's rows:\n\nRow1:1,0,0,1,1,0 – no.\n\nRow2:0,0,1,1,0,1 – two 0s, two 1s.\n\nRow3:1,1,0,0,1,0 – two 1s, two 0s.\n\nRow4:0,1,0,1,0,1 – alternating.\n\nRow5:1,0,1,0,0,1 – two 0s.\n\nRow6:0,1,1,0,1,1 – two 1s at the end.\n\nSo rows are okay.\n\nNow columns:\n\nColumn1:1,0,1,0,1,0 – alternating, okay.\n\nColumn2:0,0,1,1,0,1 – two 0s, two 1s.\n\nColumn3:0,1,0,0,1,1 – 0,1,0, then two 0s? Wait: Column3: row1:0, row2:1, row3:0, row4:0, row5:1, row6:1.\n\nSo from row3 to row5: 0,0,1. No three same.\n\nWait, row3 is 0, row4 is 0, row5 is 1. So 0,0,1 – only two 0s.\n\nSimilarly, row5 and row6:1,1 – two 1s.\n\nSo columns seem okay.\n\nNow check the counts for each row and column.\n\nEach row must have 3 zeros and 3 ones.\n\nOption D:\n\nRow1:1,0,0,1,1,0 – 0s:3, 1s:3.\n\nRow2:0,0,1,1,0,1 – 0s:3, 1s:3.\n\nRow3:1,1,0,0,1,0 – 0s:3, 1s:3.\n\nRow4:0,1,0,1,0,1 – 0s:3, 1s:3.\n\nRow5:1,0,1,0,0,1 – 0s:3, 1s:3.\n\nRow6:0,1,1,0,1,1 – 0s:3, 1s:3.\n\nSo rows are okay.\n\nColumns:\n\nColumn1:1,0,1,0,1,0 – 0s:3, 1s:3.\n\nColumn2:0,0,1,1,0,1 – 0s:3, 1s:3.\n\nColumn3:0,1,0,0,1,1 – 0s:3, 1s:3.\n\nColumn4:1,1,0,1,0,0 – 0s:3, 1s:3.\n\nColumn5:1,0,1,0,0,1 – 0s:3, 1s:3.\n\nColumn6:0,1,1,0,1,1 – 0s:3, 1s:3.\n\nSo all columns are okay.\n\nNow check for duplicate rows.\n\nOption D's rows:\n\nRow1:1 0 0 1 1 0  \nRow2:0 0 1 1 0 1  \nRow3:1 1 0 0 1 0  \nRow4:0 1 0 1 0 1  \nRow5:1 0 1 0 0 1  \nRow6:0 1 1 0 1 1  \n\nLooking for duplicates. None of these rows are identical. So that's good.\n\nNow check columns for duplicates.\n\nColumns of D:\n\nColumn1:1,0,1,0,1,0  \nColumn2:0,0,1,1,0,1  \nColumn3:0,1,0,0,1,1  \nColumn4:1,1,0,1,0,0  \nColumn5:1,0,1,0,0,1  \nColumn6:0,1,1,0,1,1  \n\nLooking at these, each column is unique. So no duplicates.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me compare columns 5 and 6.\n\nColumn5:1,0,1,0,0,1  \nColumn6:0,1,1,0,1,1  \n\nThey are different.\n\nSimilarly, columns 1 and 3 are different.\n\nSo all columns are unique.\n\nSo Option D seems to satisfy all the rules as well.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought Option A was correct. Now both A and D satisfy the rules.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it says \"the correct grid configuration\". So perhaps both A and D are valid? But the options are A, B, C, D, and I have to choose one.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed something. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in Option D, let's check the columns for any three in a row. Did I miss that?\n\nLooking at Column3 in Option D: 0,1,0,0,1,1.\n\nSo from row4 to row6: 0,0,1. That's two 0s, so okay.\n\nSimilarly, Column6:0,1,1,0,1,1. The last three are 1,1 – two 1s, so okay.\n\nSo all columns are fine.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a mistake in my earlier evaluation. Let me check if Option A is correct.\n\nOption A:\n\nRow1:1 0 0 1 1 0  \nRow2:0 0 1 1 0 1  \nRow3:1 1 0 0 1 0  \nRow4:0 1 0 1 0 1  \nRow5:1 0 1 0 0 1  \nRow6:0 1 1 0 1 0  \n\nWait, in Row4:0 1 0 1 0 1 – so no three in a row.\n\nIn Row6:0 1 1 0 1 0 – two 1s, okay.\n\nWait, but when I look at Column6 in Option A:\n\n0,1,0,1,1,0.\n\nSo the last three are 1,1,0. That's two 1s, okay.\n\nWait, but let me check the counts again for Option D's columns.\n\nWait, in Option D, Column3 is 0,1,0,0,1,1. So 0s: 3, 1s:3. Correct.\n\nBut let me think about the puzzle. Since both A and D satisfy all the rules, but the problem states that there must be a correct answer, so perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating one of them.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check for any other rules. Wait, is there any other constraint I missed? Each row and column must have equal 0s and 1s, which both satisfy. No identical rows or columns.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should check if any of the options have identical columns. Let me check Option A's columns.\n\nOption A's columns:\n\nColumn1:1,0,1,0,1,0  \nColumn2:0,0,1,1,0,1  \nColumn3:0,1,0,0,1,1  \nColumn4:1,1,0,1,0,0  \nColumn5:1,0,1,0,0,1  \nColumn6:0,1,0,1,1,0  \n\nEach is unique.\n\nOption D's columns:\n\nColumn1:1,0,1,0,1,0  \nColumn2:0,0,1,1,0,1  \nColumn3:0,1,0,0,1,1  \nColumn4:1,1,0,1,0,0  \nColumn5:1,0,1,0,0,1  \nColumn6:0,1,1,0,1,1  \n\nSo comparing to Option A, columns 1,2,3,4,5 are the same as in Option A, but column6 is different. So in D, column6 is 0,1,1,0,1,1, whereas in A it's 0,1,0,1,1,0.\n\nSo both A and D have unique columns, but the problem is that both seem to satisfy the rules.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"the correct grid configuration\", implying only one is correct. So perhaps I missed something.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for any other constraints or perhaps one of them has a row or column that doesn't have exactly three 0s and 1s.\n\nWait, let me recount for Option D, column5.\n\nColumn5 in D:1,0,1,0,0,1.\n\nSo 0s: row2, row4, row5: three. 1s: row1, row3, row6: three. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, column6:0,1,1,0,1,1. 0s: row1, row4: two, wait. Wait, row1:0, row2:1, row3:0, row4:0, row5:1, row6:1.\n\nWait, no, in column6 of D:\n\nRow1:0  \nRow2:1  \nRow3:0  \nRow4:0  \nRow5:1  \nRow6:1  \n\nSo 0s: row1, row3, row4: three. 1s: row2, row5, row6: three. Correct.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought Option D's column6 was 0,1,1,0,1,1. Let me confirm.\n\nOption D's rows:\n\nRow1:1 0 0 1 1 0 → column6:0  \nRow2:0 0 1 1 0 1 → column6:1  \nRow3:1 1 0 0 1 0 → column6:0  \nRow4:0 1 0 1 0 1 → column6:1  \nRow5:1 0 1 0 0 1 → column6:1  \nRow6:0 1 1 0 1 1 → column6:1  \n\nWait, no. That's not correct. Row3's column6 is 0, row4's column6 is1, row5's column6 is1, row6's column6 is1.\n\nSo column6 in D is: 0,1,0,1,1,1. Wait, that's 0,1,0,1,1,1.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the user provided Option D as:\n\n1 0 0 1 1 0  \n0 0 1 1 0 1  \n1 1 0 0 1 0  \n0 1 0 1 0 1  \n1 0 1 0 0 1  \n0 1 1 0 1 1  \n\nSo each row is:\n\nRow1:1 0 0 1 1 0  \nRow2:0 0 1 1 0 1  \nRow3:1 1 0 0 1 0  \nRow4:0 1 0 1 0 1  \nRow5:1 0 1 0 0 1  \nRow6:0 1 1 0 1 1  \n\nSo column6 is:\n\nRow1:0  \nRow2:1  \nRow3:0  \nRow4:1  \nRow5:1  \nRow6:1  \n\nSo column6:0,1,0,1,1,1.\n\nWait, that's 0,1,0,1,1,1. So from row4 to row6:1,1,1. That's three 1s in a row. So that violates rule 2. Oh no! So Option D's column6 has three 1s in a row. So D is invalid.\n\nI must have made a mistake earlier. So in Option D, column6 is 0,1,0,1,1,1. So the last three are 1,1,1. That's three in a row, which is not allowed. So D is invalid.\n\nSo that leaves us with Option A as the only valid one.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought column6 in D was 0,1,1,0,1,1, but that's incorrect. It's actually 0,1,0,1,1,1. So the last three are 1s, which is invalid.\n\nSo the correct answer is Option A.\n</think>\n\nThe correct answer is **Option A**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{A}", "ground_truth": "A", "prompt": "You need to solve a Binairo puzzle (Size: 6x6).You need to solve a Binairo puzzle.\n\n**Binairo Puzzle Rules:**\n1.

{"question_id": "binairo_666", "response": "Alright, so I've got this Binairo puzzle to solve, and I need to choose the correct solution from options A, B, C, or D. Let me start by recalling the rules to make sure I don't miss anything.\n\nFirst, the basics: each cell must be 0 or 1. No more than two identical numbers in a row or column consecutively. Each row and column must have an equal number of 0s and 1s. Also, no two rows or columns can be identical. Got it.\n\nLooking at the options, each is a 6x6 grid. I'll need to check each option against the rules. Maybe I can go through each option one by one, checking for violations.\n\nStarting with Option A:\n\nOption A:\n1 1 0 1 0 0  \n1 1 0 0 1 0  \n0 0 1 0 1 1  \n1 0 1 1 0 0  \n0 1 0 0 1 1  \n0 0 1 1 0 1  \n\nLet me check the first row: 1 1 0 1 0 0. Hmm, there are two 1s at the start, which is allowed. But then after the two 1s, it alternates. Wait, let me check for three consecutive same numbers. I don't see any. So that's fine.\n\nNow, check each row for equal 0s and 1s. Each row should have 3 zeros and 3 ones.\n\nRow 1: 1,1,0,1,0,0. That's four 1s and two 0s. Wait, that's not equal. So Option A violates rule 3. So Option A is invalid. So I can eliminate A.\n\nMoving on to Option B:\n\nOption B:\n0 1 0 1 0 0  \n1 1 0 0 1 0  \n0 0 1 0 1 1  \n1 0 1 1 0 0  \n0 1 0 0 1 1  \n0 0 1 1 0 1  \n\nFirst, check each row for equal 0s and 1s.\n\nRow 1: 0,1,0,1,0,0. That's four 0s and two 1s. Not equal. So Option B is invalid. So B is out.\n\nOption C:\n\nOption C:\n1 1 0 1 0 0  \n1 1 0 0 1 0  \n0 0 1 0 1 1  \n1 0 1 0 0 0  \n0 1 0 0 1 1  \n0 0 1 1 0 1  \n\nLet's check each row.\n\nRow 1: 1,1,0,1,0,0. That's four 1s and two 0s. Not equal. So same as A, invalid. So C is out.\n\nWait, hold on, did I do that right? Let me double-check.\n\nRow 1: 1,1,0,1,0,0. So positions 1,2,4 are 1s. That's three 1s, and the rest are 0s. So three 1s and three 0s. Wait, no, 1,1,0,1,0,0: 1 appears in positions 1,2,4: that's three 1s. 0s in 3,5,6: three 0s. So equal. I must have miscounted earlier.\n\nWait, my mistake. So three 1s and three 0s. So Row 1 is okay.\n\nWait, let me recount: 1,1,0,1,0,0. So 1s: 1,2,4. That's three. 0s: 3,5,6. Three as well. So Row 1 is okay.\n\nNext, check for consecutive duplicates. Row 1: 1,1,0,1,0,0. So two 1s at the start, then a 0, then a 1, then 0,0. So two 0s at the end. So that's two consecutive, which is allowed. So no issues here.\n\nNow check Row 2: 1,1,0,0,1,0. So two 1s, two 0s, then a 1, 0. Consecutive duplicates: two 1s, two 0s, which is allowed. Counts: 1s: positions 1,2,5: three. 0s: 3,4,6: three. So equal.\n\nRow 3: 0,0,1,0,1,1. So two 0s, then 1, then 0,1,1. Consecutive duplicates: two 0s, two 1s at the end. Allowed. Counts: 0s: 1,2,4: three. 1s: 3,5,6: three. Okay.\n\nRow 4: 1,0,1,0,0,0. So 1,0,1,0, then three 0s. Wait, three 0s in a row is not allowed. So that's a violation. So Option C is invalid because Row 4 has three consecutive 0s. So C is out.\n\nMoving on to Option D:\n\nOption D:\n1 1 0 1 0 0  \n1 1 0 0 1 0  \n0 0 1 0 1 1  \n1 0 1 1 0 0  \n0 1 0 0 1 1  \n0 0 1 1 0 0  \n\nLet me check each row first for equal 0s and 1s.\n\nRow 1: 1,1,0,1,0,0. Three 1s and three 0s. Okay.\n\nRow 2: 1,1,0,0,1,0. Three 1s (positions 1,2,5) and three 0s (3,4,6). Okay.\n\nRow 3: 0,0,1,0,1,1. Three 0s (1,2,4) and three 1s (3,5,6). Okay.\n\nRow 4: 1,0,1,1,0,0. Let's count: 1s at 1,3,4; 0s at 2,5,6. So equal. But wait, looking at the row: 1,0,1,1,0,0. There's two 1s at positions 3 and 4, then two 0s at 5 and 6. So that's allowed. No three in a row. So okay.\n\nRow 5: 0,1,0,0,1,1. Let's check for consecutive duplicates: 0,1,0,0,1,1. So two 0s at 3,4 and two 1s at 5,6. Allowed. Counts: 0s at 1,3,4 (three), 1s at 2,5,6 (three). Okay.\n\nRow 6: 0,0,1,1,0,0. Consecutive duplicates: two 0s, two 1s, two 0s. Allowed. Counts: 0s at 1,2,5,6 (four) and 1s at 3,4 (two). Wait, that's not equal. So Row 6 has four 0s and two 1s. That violates rule 3. So Option D is invalid.\n\nWait, did I count that right? Row 6: 0,0,1,1,0,0. So 0s are at positions 1,2,5,6: four 0s. 1s at 3,4: two 1s. So unequal. So D is invalid.\n\nHmm, so none of the options seem valid? But the user said there must be a right answer. Did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, let me recheck each option.\n\nStarting again with Option A:\n\nRow 1: four 1s, two 0s. So invalid.\n\nOption B: Row 1: four 0s, two 1s. Invalid.\n\nOption C: Row 4 has three 0s. So invalid.\n\nOption D: Row 6 has four 0s. Invalid.\n\nWait, so none of the options satisfy rule 3? That can't be right. Maybe I made a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, let me double-check Option D's Row 6: 0,0,1,1,0,0. So 0s: positions 1,2,5,6: four. 1s: 3,4: two. So unequal. So D is invalid.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the options. Let me check again.\n\nOption C's Row 4: 1,0,1,0,0,0. So positions 5 and 6 are 0s, so three 0s at the end. So three consecutive 0s, which violates rule 2.\n\nSo all options except maybe I didn't check correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check the columns as well, but maybe I can spot something else.\n\nWait, in Option D, Row 6 is 0,0,1,1,0,0. So columns might also have duplicates.\n\nWait, maybe I should check the columns for duplicates as well.\n\nLet me check Option D's columns.\n\nColumn 1: 1,1,0,1,0,0. So 1,1,0,1,0,0. Check for three in a row: no. Equal 0s and 1s: three 1s and three 0s. Okay.\n\nColumn 2: 1,1,0,0,1,0. 1,1,0,0,1,0. No three in a row. 1s: positions 1,2,5 (three), 0s: 3,4,6 (three). Okay.\n\nColumn 3: 0,0,1,1,0,1. 0,0,1,1,0,1. No three in a row. 0s: 1,2,5 (three), 1s: 3,4,6 (three). Okay.\n\nColumn 4: 1,0,0,1,0,0. 1,0,0,1,0,0. Let's see: 1,0,0,1,0,0. No three in a row. 1s: 1,4 (two), 0s: 2,3,5,6 (four). Wait, that's unequal. So Column 4 in Option D has four 0s and two 1s. So that violates rule 3. So Option D is invalid.\n\nWait, that's a problem. So all options have some issue.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in evaluating Option C.\n\nOption C: Row 4 is 1,0,1,0,0,0. So three 0s at the end. That's three in a row, which is invalid. So C is out.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in checking Option B.\n\nOption B: Let me recheck Option B's rows.\n\nOption B:\n0 1 0 1 0 0  \n1 1 0 0 1 0  \n0 0 1 0 1 1  \n1 0 1 1 0 0  \n0 1 0 0 1 1  \n0 0 1 1 0 1  \n\nRow 1: 0,1,0,1,0,0. So 0s: 1,3,5,6 (four), 1s: 2,4 (two). So unequal. So invalid.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in counting Option D's columns. Let me check each column in Option D.\n\nOption D columns:\n\nColumn 1: 1,1,0,1,0,0. So 1,1,0,1,0,0. 1s: 1,2,4 (three), 0s: 3,5,6 (three). Okay.\n\nColumn 2: 1,1,0,0,1,0. 1s: 1,2,5 (three), 0s: 3,4,6 (three). Okay.\n\nColumn 3: 0,0,1,1,0,1. 0s: 1,2,5 (three), 1s: 3,4,6 (three). Okay.\n\nColumn 4: 1,0,0,1,0,0. So 1,0,0,1,0,0. 1s: 1,4 (two), 0s: 2,3,5,6 (four). So unequal. So column 4 in D is invalid.\n\nSo D is out.\n\nWait, but the user said there must be a right answer. Did I miscount somewhere?\n\nLet me check Option C again.\n\nOption C:\n\n1 1 0 1 0 0  \n1 1 0 0 1 0  \n0 0 1 0 1 1  \n1 0 1 0 0 0  \n0 1 0 0 1 1  \n0 0 1 1 0 1  \n\nRow 1: 1,1,0,1,0,0. 1s: 1,2,4 (three), 0s: 3,5,6 (three). Okay.\n\nRow 2: 1,1,0,0,1,0. 1s: 1,2,5 (three), 0s: 3,4,6 (three). Okay.\n\nRow 3: 0,0,1,0,1,1. 0s: 1,2,4 (three), 1s: 3,5,6 (three). Okay.\n\nRow 4: 1,0,1,0,0,0. 1s: 1,3 (two), 0s: 2,4,5,6 (four). So unequal. So Row 4 is invalid. So C is out.\n\nWait, so all options have some issue. But the user says there must be a right answer. Maybe I made a mistake in checking.\n\nWait, let me check Option D again. Maybe I made a mistake in counting the columns.\n\nOption D's columns:\n\nColumn 1: 1,1,0,1,0,0. 1s: 1,2,4 (three), 0s: 3,5,6 (three). Okay.\n\nColumn 2: 1,1,0,0,1,0. 1s: 1,2,5 (three), 0s: 3,4,6 (three). Okay.\n\nColumn 3: 0,0,1,1,0,1. 0s: 1,2,5 (three), 1s: 3,4,6 (three). Okay.\n\nColumn 4: 1,0,0,1,0,0. 1s: 1,4 (two), 0s: 2,3,5,6 (four). So unequal. So column 4 is invalid.\n\nWait, but maybe I should check for duplicates in columns as well as rows.\n\nWait, let's check for identical rows or columns.\n\nIn Option D, let's check if any rows are identical.\n\nRow 1: 1 1 0 1 0 0\n\nRow 2: 1 1 0 0 1 0\n\nRow 3: 0 0 1 0 1 1\n\nRow 4: 1 0 1 1 0 0\n\nRow 5: 0 1 0 0 1 1\n\nRow 6: 0 0 1 1 0 0\n\nLooking at these, none seem identical.\n\nColumns:\n\nColumn 1: 1,1,0,1,0,0\n\nColumn 2:1,1,0,0,1,0\n\nColumn 3:0,0,1,1,0,1\n\nColumn 4:1,0,0,1,0,0\n\nColumn 5:0,1,1,0,1,0\n\nColumn 6:0,0,1,0,1,0\n\nAre any columns identical?\n\nLooking at Column 1: 1,1,0,1,0,0\n\nColumn 2:1,1,0,0,1,0\n\nDifferent.\n\nColumn 3:0,0,1,1,0,1\n\nColumn 4:1,0,0,1,0,0\n\nDifferent.\n\nColumn 5:0,1,1,0,1,0\n\nColumn 6:0,0,1,0,1,0\n\nDifferent. So no identical columns.\n\nBut column 4 has unequal counts, so D is invalid.\n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake in counting rows in Option C.\n\nOption C:\n\nRow 4: 1 0 1 0 0 0. So positions 5 and 6 are 0s, so that's three 0s in a row. So violates rule 2.\n\nSo, all options seem invalid. But the user says one must be correct. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted Option B's rows.\n\nOption B:\n\nRow 1:0 1 0 1 0 0. So 0s: 1,3,5,6 (four), 1s: 2,4 (two). Unequal. So invalid.\n\nWait, maybe I should check Option A again.\n\nOption A:\n\nRow 1:1 1 0 1 0 0. So 1s:1,2,4 (three), 0s:3,5,6 (three). Okay.\n\nRow 2:1 1 0 0 1 0. 1s:1,2,5 (three), 0s:3,4,6 (three). Okay.\n\nRow 3:0 0 1 0 1 1. 0s:1,2,4 (three), 1s:3,5,6 (three). Okay.\n\nRow 4:1 0 1 1 0 0. 1s:1,3,4 (three), 0s:2,5,6 (three). Okay.\n\nRow 5:0 1 0 0 1 1. 0s:1,3,4 (three), 1s:2,5,6 (three). Okay.\n\nRow 6:0 0 1 1 0 1. 0s:1,2,5 (three), 1s:3,4,6 (three). Okay.\n\nSo rows are okay. Now check for consecutive duplicates.\n\nRow 1:1,1,0,1,0,0. Two 1s, then 0,1,0,0. So no three in a row. Okay.\n\nRow 2:1,1,0,0,1,0. Two 1s, two 0s, 1,0. Okay.\n\nRow 3:0,0,1,0,1,1. Two 0s, 1,0,1,1. Two 1s at the end. Okay.\n\nRow 4:1,0,1,1,0,0. 1,0,1,1,0,0. Two 1s, then two 0s. Okay.\n\nRow 5:0,1,0,0,1,1. 0,1,0,0,1,1. Two 0s, two 1s. Okay.\n\nRow 6:0,0,1,1,0,1. Two 0s, two 1s, 0,1. Okay.\n\nNow check columns for equal counts and no three in a row.\n\nColumn 1:1,1,0,1,0,0. 1s:1,2,4 (three), 0s:3,5,6 (three). Okay.\n\nColumn 2:1,1,0,0,1,0. 1s:1,2,5 (three), 0s:3,4,6 (three). Okay.\n\nColumn 3:0,0,1,1,0,1. 0s:1,2,5 (three), 1s:3,4,6 (three). Okay.\n\nColumn 4:1,0,0,1,0,0. 1s:1,4 (two), 0s:2,3,5,6 (four). So unequal. So column 4 in Option A has four 0s and two 1s. So violates rule 3.\n\nWait, that's a problem. So Option A is invalid.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought Option A was invalid because Row 1 had unequal counts, but now I'm seeing that actually, rows are okay, but columns aren't.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought Option A's Row 1 had four 1s, but now I see it's three. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let me recount Option A's rows:\n\nOption A:\n\nRow 1:1,1,0,1,0,0. 1s: 1,2,4. Three. 0s:3,5,6. Three. Okay.\n\nRow 2:1,1,0,0,1,0. 1s:1,2,5. Three. 0s:3,4,6. Three. Okay.\n\nRow 3:0,0,1,0,1,1. 0s:1,2,4. Three. 1s:3,5,6. Three. Okay.\n\nRow 4:1,0,1,1,0,0. 1s:1,3,4. Three. 0s:2,5,6. Three. Okay.\n\nRow 5:0,1,0,0,1,1. 0s:1,3,4. Three. 1s:2,5,6. Three. Okay.\n\nRow 6:0,0,1,1,0,1. 0s:1,2,5. Three. 1s:3,4,6. Three. Okay.\n\nSo all rows are okay.\n\nBut columns:\n\nColumn 4:1,0,0,1,0,0. So 1s:1,4 (two). 0s:2,3,5,6 (four). Unequal. So Option A is invalid.\n\nWait, so none of the options are valid. But that can't be. The user says there's a right answer.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in checking Option D's columns.\n\nOption D:\n\nColumn 1:1,1,0,1,0,0. 1s:1,2,4. Three. 0s:3,5,6. Three.

So 1s: positions 1 and 6 (two), 0s: 2,3,4,5 (four). So unequal. So Option C is invalid.\n\nWait, so all options are invalid? That can't be. I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for an option where all rows and columns have equal counts and no three in a row, and no identical rows or columns.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating Option D's columns.\n\nOption D's Column 4:1,0,0,1,0,0. So 1s: positions 1 and 4. Two. 0s: 2,3,5,6. Four. So unequal.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check if any option has columns with equal counts.\n\nWait, perhaps Option B's columns:\n\nOption B's Column 1:0,1,0,1,0,0. 0s: four, 1s: two. So invalid.\n\nSo, I'm stuck. Maybe the correct answer is D, even though Column 4 is unequal. Or perhaps I made a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, let me recount Option D's columns:\n\nOption D:\n\nRow 1:1 1 0 1 0 0\n\nRow 2:1 1 0 0 1 0\n\nRow 3:0 0 1 0 1 1\n\nRow 4:1 0 1 1 0 0\n\nRow 5:0 1 0 0 1 1\n\nRow 6:0 0 1 1 0 0\n\nSo Column 4:\n\nRow 1:1\n\nRow 2:0\n\nRow 3:0\n\nRow 4:1\n\nRow 5:0\n\nRow 6:1\n\nWait, no. Wait, Row 6 in Option D is 0,0,1,1,0,0. So Column 4 is:\n\nRow 1:1\n\nRow 2:0\n\nRow 3:0\n\nRow 4:1\n\nRow 5:0\n\nRow 6:1\n\nSo Column 4:1,0,0,1,0,1. So 1s: positions 1,4,6 (three), 0s:2,3,5 (three). Oh! I must have misread Row 6's Column 4 earlier. So 1s: three, 0s: three. Okay.\n\nWait, so Column 4 in D is okay.\n\nWait, so I must have made a mistake earlier. Let me recount.\n\nOption D's Column 4:\n\nRow 1:1\n\nRow 2:0\n\nRow 3:0\n\nRow 4:1\n\nRow 5:0\n\nRow 6:1\n\nSo 1s: 1,4,6 (three). 0s:2,3,5 (three). Okay.\n\nSo Column 4 is okay.\n\nNow, check for consecutive duplicates in columns.\n\nColumn 4:1,0,0,1,0,1.\n\nLooking for three in a row: no. 0s at 2,3; 1s at 1,4,6. No three in a row. Okay.\n\nNow, check columns for identical columns.\n\nIn Option D:\n\nColumn 1:1,1,0,1,0,0\n\nColumn 2:1,1,0,0,1,0\n\nColumn 3:0,0,1,1,0,1\n\nColumn 4:1,0,0,1,0,1\n\nColumn 5:0,1,1,0,1,0\n\nColumn 6:0,0,1,0,1,0\n\nAre any columns identical? Let's see.\n\nCompare Column 1 and Column 2: different.\n\nColumn 3 and others: unique.\n\nColumn 4: unique.\n\nColumn 5: unique.\n\nColumn 6: unique.\n\nSo no identical columns.\n\nNow, check rows for identical rows.\n\nOption D's rows:\n\nRow 1:1,1,0,1,0,0\n\nRow 2:1,1,0,0,1,0\n\nRow 3:0,0,1,0,1,1\n\nRow 4:1,0,1,1,0,0\n\nRow 5:0,1,0,0,1,1\n\nRow 6:0,0,1,1,0,0\n\nLooking for identical rows. None seem identical.\n\nNow, check each row for equal 0s and 1s.\n\nRow 1: three 1s, three 0s. Okay.\n\nRow 2: three 1s, three 0s. Okay.\n\nRow 3: three 0s, three 1s. Okay.\n\nRow 4: three 1s, three 0s. Okay.\n\nRow 5: three 0s, three 1s. Okay.\n\nRow 6: three 0s, three 1s. Okay.\n\nNow, check each row for no more than two consecutive same numbers.\n\nRow 1:1,1,0,1,0,0. No three in a row. Okay.\n\nRow 2:1,1,0,0,1,0. No three in a row. Okay.\n\nRow 3:0,0,1,0,1,1. No three in a row. Okay.\n\nRow 4:1,0,1,1,0,0. No three in a row. Okay.\n\nRow 5:0,1,0,0,1,1. No three in a row. Okay.\n\nRow 6:0,0,1,1,0,0. No three in a row. Okay.\n\nNow, check columns for no more than two consecutive same numbers.\n\nColumn 1:1,1,0,1,0,0. 1,1 is two, then 0,1,0,0. No three in a row. Okay.\n\nColumn 2:1,1,0,0,1,0. 1,1 is two, 0,0 is two, then 1,0. Okay.\n\nColumn 3:0,0,1,1,0,1. 0,0 is two, 1,1 is two, 0,1. Okay.\n\nColumn 4:1,0,0,1,0,1. 0,0 is two, rest are single. Okay.\n\nColumn 5:0,1,1,0,1,0. 1,1 is two, rest are single. Okay.\n\nColumn 6:0,0,1,0,1,0. 0,0 is two, rest are single. Okay.\n\nSo all columns are okay.\n\nNow, check for identical columns.\n\nAs above, all columns are unique.\n\nSo, after rechecking, Option D seems to satisfy all rules.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought Row 6 had four 0s, but now I see it's three.\n\nWait, let me recount Option D's Row 6:0,0,1,1,0,0.\n\n0s: positions 1,2,5,6. Wait, that's four 0s. Oh no! So Row 6 has four 0s and two 1s. So violates rule 3.\n\nWait, so I must have miscounted earlier.\n\nWait, Row 6:0,0,1,1,0,0.\n\n0s: 1,2,5,6: four.\n\n1s: 3,4: two.\n\nSo unequal. So Option D is invalid.\n\nWait, so I must have made a mistake earlier when I thought Column 4 was okay, but Row 6 is invalid.\n\nSo, all options seem invalid. But the user says there must be a right answer. Maybe I made a mistake in evaluating.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check Option B again.\n\nOption B:\n\nRow 1:0,1,0,1,0,0. 0s: four, 1s: two.

{"question_id": "binairo_733", "response": "Okay, so I have to solve this Binairo puzzle and choose the correct option among A, B, C, or D. Let me remember the rules first.\n\n1. Each cell is either 0 or 1.\n2. No more than two consecutive identical numbers in any row or column. So, no three in a row, whether it's 000 or 111.\n3. Each row and column must have an equal number of 0s and 1s. Since it's a 6x6 grid, each row and column must have exactly 3 zeros and 3 ones.\n4. No two rows can be identical, and no two columns can be identical.\n\nAlright, so I need to check each option against these rules.\n\nLet me start by looking at each option one by one.\n\n**Option A:**\n```\n1 0 1 1 0 0\n1 1 0 1 0 0\n0 1 0 0 1 1\n1 0 1 0 1 0\n0 1 0 1 0 1\n0 0 1 0 1 1\n```\n\nFirst, check for three consecutive same numbers.\n\nLooking at row 1: 1 0 1 1 0 0. There are two 1s together, then two 0s. So no three in a row. Good.\n\nRow 2: 1 1 0 1 0 0. Again, two 1s, then two 0s. Fine.\n\nRow 3: 0 1 0 0 1 1. Here, two 0s and two 1s at the end. Fine.\n\nRow 4: 1 0 1 0 1 0. Alternating, no issues.\n\nRow 5: 0 1 0 1 0 1. Alternating, good.\n\nRow 6: 0 0 1 0 1 1. Two 0s and two 1s. Good.\n\nNow, check columns.\n\nColumn 1: 1,1,0,1,0,0. Let's see: 1,1 is two, then 0,1,0,0. The last three are 0,0, which is two, so okay.\n\nColumn 2: 0,1,1,0,1,0. 0,1,1 is two 1s, then 0,1,0. No three in a row.\n\nColumn 3: 1,0,0,1,0,1. 1,0,0 is two 0s, then 1,0,1. No problem.\n\nColumn 4: 1,1,0,0,1,0. 1,1 is two, then 0,0 is two, then 1,0. Fine.\n\nColumn 5: 0,0,1,1,0,1. Two 0s, two 1s. Fine.\n\nColumn 6: 0,0,1,0,1,1. Two 0s, then 1,0,1,1. Wait, the last two are 1s. So 1,1 at the end. That's two, which is allowed. So no three in a row.\n\nOkay, so no rule 2 violations.\n\nNow, check each row has exactly three 0s and three 1s.\n\nRow 1: 1,0,1,1,0,0 → counts: 3 zeros, 3 ones. Good.\n\nRow 2: 1,1,0,1,0,0 → 3 zeros, 3 ones. Good.\n\nRow 3: 0,1,0,0,1,1 → 3 zeros, 3 ones. Good.\n\nRow 4: 1,0,1,0,1,0 → 3 each. Good.\n\nRow 5: 0,1,0,1,0,1 → 3 each. Good.\n\nRow 6: 0,0,1,0,1,1 → 3 each. Good.\n\nNow, check columns. Each column must have three 0s and three 1s.\n\nColumn 1: 1,1,0,1,0,0 → 3 ones (positions 1,2,4) and 3 zeros (3,5,6). Good.\n\nColumn 2: 0,1,1,0,1,0 → 3 ones (2,3,5) and 3 zeros (1,4,6). Good.\n\nColumn 3: 1,0,0,1,0,1 → 3 ones (1,4,6) and 3 zeros (2,3,5). Good.\n\nColumn 4: 1,1,0,0,1,0 → 3 ones (1,2,5) and 3 zeros (3,4,6). Good.\n\nColumn 5: 0,0,1,1,0,1 → 3 ones (3,4,6) and 3 zeros (1,2,5). Good.\n\nColumn 6: 0,0,1,0,1,1 → 3 ones (3,5,6) and 3 zeros (1,2,4). Good.\n\nSo rule 3 is satisfied.\n\nNext, check that no two rows are identical.\n\nLooking at the rows:\n\nRow 1: 1 0 1 1 0 0\n\nRow 2: 1 1 0 1 0 0\n\nRow 3: 0 1 0 0 1 1\n\nRow 4: 1 0 1 0 1 0\n\nRow 5: 0 1 0 1 0 1\n\nRow 6: 0 0 1 0 1 1\n\nNone of these rows are duplicates. So rule 4 is satisfied for rows.\n\nNow, check columns for uniqueness.\n\nEach column must be unique.\n\nLet's list each column as a string.\n\nColumn 1: 1,1,0,1,0,0 → \"110100\"\n\nColumn 2: 0,1,1,0,1,0 → \"011010\"\n\nColumn 3: 1,0,0,1,0,1 → \"100101\"\n\nColumn 4: 1,1,0,0,1,0 → \"110010\"\n\nColumn 5: 0,0,1,1,0,1 → \"001101\"\n\nColumn 6: 0,0,1,0,1,1 → \"001011\"\n\nAre any of these columns duplicates? Let me see.\n\nLooking at the column strings:\n\n110100, 011010, 100101, 110010, 001101, 001011.\n\nEach is unique. So rule 4 is satisfied for columns as well.\n\nSo, Option A seems to satisfy all the rules. But let me check the other options just in case.\n\n**Option B:**\n```\n0 0 1 1 0 0\n1 1 0 1 0 0\n0 1 0 0 1 1\n1 0 1 0 1 0\n0 1 0 1 0 1\n0 0 1 0 1 1\n```\n\nFirst, check for three consecutive same numbers.\n\nRow 1: 0 0 1 1 0 0 → two 0s, two 1s, two 0s. Fine.\n\nRow 2: 1 1 0 1 0 0 → two 1s, then two 0s. Fine.\n\nRow 3: 0 1 0 0 1 1 → two 0s, two 1s. Fine.\n\nRow 4: 1 0 1 0 1 0 → alternating, no issues.\n\nRow 5: 0 1 0 1 0 1 → alternating, good.\n\nRow 6: 0 0 1 0 1 1 → two 0s, then two 1s. Fine.\n\nColumns:\n\nColumn 1: 0,1,0,1,0,0 → 0,1,0,1,0,0. No three in a row.\n\nColumn 2: 0,1,1,0,1,0 → two 1s, then 0,1,0. Fine.\n\nColumn 3: 1,0,0,1,0,1 → two 0s, then 1,0,1. Fine.\n\nColumn 4: 1,1,0,0,1,0 → two 1s, two 0s. Fine.\n\nColumn 5: 0,0,1,1,0,1 → two 0s, two 1s. Fine.\n\nColumn 6: 0,0,1,0,1,1 → two 0s, two 1s. Fine.\n\nSo no rule 2 issues.\n\nCheck each row has 3 zeros and 3 ones.\n\nRow 1: 0,0,1,1,0,0 → 4 zeros? Wait: 0,0,1,1,0,0 → that's 4 zeros and 2 ones. Oh no! That's a problem. Rule 3 violated because it's not equal numbers.\n\nSo Option B is invalid. So I can eliminate B.\n\n**Option C:**\n```\n1 0 1 1 0 0\n1 1 0 1 0 0\n0 1 0 0 1 1\n1 0 1 1 1 0\n0 1 0 1 0 1\n0 0 1 0 1 1\n```\n\nCheck for three consecutive same numbers.\n\nRow 1: 1,0,1,1,0,0 → two 1s, two 0s. Fine.\n\nRow 2: 1,1,0,1,0,0 → two 1s, two 0s. Fine.\n\nRow 3: 0,1,0,0,1,1 → two 0s, two 1s. Fine.\n\nRow 4: 1,0,1,1,1,0 → Wait, here we have three 1s in a row: positions 3,4,5 are 1,1,1. That's three in a row, which violates rule 2. So Option C is invalid.\n\n**Option D:**\n```\n1 0 1 1 0 0\n1 1 0 1 0 0\n0 1 0 0 1 1\n1 0 1 0 1 0\n0 1 0 1 0 1\n0 0 1 0 1 0\n```\n\nFirst, check for three consecutive same numbers.\n\nRow 1: 1,0,1,1,0,0 → two 1s, two 0s. Fine.\n\nRow 2: 1,1,0,1,0,0 → two 1s, two 0s. Fine.\n\nRow 3: 0,1,0,0,1,1 → two 0s, two 1s. Fine.\n\nRow 4: 1,0,1,0,1,0 → alternating, no issues.\n\nRow 5: 0,1,0,1,0,1 → alternating, good.\n\nRow 6: 0,0,1,0,1,0 → two 0s, then 1,0,1,0. Fine.\n\nNow, check columns.\n\nColumn 1: 1,1,0,1,0,0 → 1,1 is two, then 0,1,0,0. No three in a row.\n\nColumn 2: 0,1,1,0,1,0 → 1,1 is two, then 0,1,0. Fine.\n\nColumn 3: 1,0,0,1,0,1 → 0,0 is two, then 1,0,1. Fine.\n\nColumn 4: 1,1,0,0,1,0 → 1,1 is two, 0,0 is two, then 1,0. Fine.\n\nColumn 5: 0,0,1,1,0,1 → 0,0 is two, 1,1 is two, then 0,1. Fine.\n\nColumn 6: 0,0,1,0,1,0 → 0,0 is two, then 1,0,1,0. Fine.\n\nSo no rule 2 issues.\n\nNow, check each row has three 0s and three 1s.\n\nRow 1: 1,0,1,1,0,0 → 3 zeros, 3 ones. Good.\n\nRow 2: 1,1,0,1,0,0 → 3 zeros, 3 ones. Good.\n\nRow 3: 0,1,0,0,1,1 → 3 zeros, 3 ones. Good.\n\nRow 4: 1,0,1,0,1,0 → 3 zeros, 3 ones. Good.\n\nRow 5: 0,1,0,1,0,1 → 3 zeros, 3 ones. Good.\n\nRow 6: 0,0,1,0,1,0 → 3 zeros (positions 1,2,4,6) Wait, that's four zeros? Wait no:\n\nRow 6: 0,0,1,0,1,0. Let's count: 0,0,1,0,1,0 → zeros at 1,2,4,6: that's four zeros and two ones. Oh! That violates rule 3. So Option D is invalid.\n\nWait, that's a problem. So row 6 in D has four 0s and two 1s. So it's invalid.\n\nWait, but I thought it was okay earlier.

So rule 3 is violated. So D is invalid.\n\nSo, only Option A remains. But wait, earlier when I checked Option A, everything was fine. So why is the user asking me to choose from A, B, C, D? Because A is valid, but maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me double-check Option A's row 6: 0 0 1 0 1 1.\n\nWait, zeros: 1,2,4 → three. Ones: 3,5,6 → three. So 3 each. Okay.\n\nWait, in Option D, row 6: 0 0 1 0 1 0. Zeros: 1,2,4,6 → four. So that's why D is invalid.\n\nSo only Option A is valid. So I think the answer is A.\n\nWait, but let me check the columns for uniqueness in Option A, to make sure.\n\nOption A's columns:\n\nColumn 1: 1,1,0,1,0,0 → \"110100\"\n\nColumn 2: 0,1,1,0,1,0 → \"011010\"\n\nColumn 3: 1,0,0,1,0,1 → \"100101\"\n\nColumn 4: 1,1,0,0,1,0 → \"110010\"\n\nColumn 5: 0,0,1,1,0,1 → \"001101\"\n\nColumn 6: 0,0,1,0,1,1 → \"001011\"\n\nAre any of these duplicates?\n\nLooking at the column strings:\n\n110100, 011010, 100101, 110010, 001101, 001011.\n\nEach is unique.

Let me first make sure I understand the rules properly because that will help me check each option systematically.\n\nBinairo rules:\n\n1. Each cell must be 0 or 1.\n2. No more than two consecutive identical numbers in any row or column. So, sequences like 000 or 111 are not allowed.\n3. Each row and column must have an equal number of 0s and 1s. Since it's a 4x4 grid, each row and column must have exactly two 0s and two 1s.\n4. No two rows can be identical, and no two columns can be identical.\n\nAlright, so I need to check each option against these four rules.\n\nLet me start by looking at Option A:\n\nOption A:\n0 1 1 0\n1 0 1 0\n1 0 0 1\n0 1 0 1\n\nFirst, checking Rule 3: Each row must have two 0s and two 1s.\n\nLet's count for each row:\n\nRow 1: 0,1,1,0 → two 0s and two 1s. Good.\nRow 2: 1,0,1,0 → same. Good.\nRow 3: 1,0,0,1 → same. Good.\nRow 4: 0,1,0,1 → same. Good.\n\nColumns: Let's check each column.\n\nColumn 1: 0,1,1,0 → two 0s and two 1s. Good.\nColumn 2: 1,0,0,1 → same. Good.\nColumn 3: 1,1,0,0 → same. Good.\nColumn 4: 0,0,1,1 → same. Good.\n\nSo Rule 3 is satisfied for Option A.\n\nNext, Rule 2: No three consecutive same numbers.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\nRow 1: 0,1,1,0. The 1s are only two in a row, so that's okay. No three in a row. Good.\nRow 2: 1,0,1,0. Alternating, so no issue. Good.\nRow 3: 1,0,0,1. The 0s are two in a row, but that's allowed. Good.\nRow 4: 0,1,0,1. Alternating. Good.\n\nNow columns:\n\nColumn 1: 0,1,1,0. The two 1s in the middle. Allowed. No three.\nColumn 2: 1,0,0,1. Two 0s. Allowed.\nColumn 3: 1,1,0,0. Two 1s, then two 0s. Allowed.\nColumn 4: 0,0,1,1. Two 0s, then two 1s. Allowed.\n\nSo Rule 2 is satisfied.\n\nRule 4: No two identical rows or columns.\n\nCheck rows:\n\nRow 1: 0 1 1 0\nRow 2: 1 0 1 0\nRow 3: 1 0 0 1\nRow 4: 0 1 0 1\n\nAre any rows identical?

So Rule 4 is satisfied.\n\nTherefore, Option A satisfies all rules. Hmm, but I need to check the other options too because maybe more than one satisfies, but the user says there is a right answer, so perhaps only one is correct.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in checking. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, I think I need to check for Rule 2 more carefully. Let's look at each row and column again.\n\nRow 1: 0,1,1,0. No three in a row. Good.\nRow 2: 1,0,1,0. Good.\nRow 3: 1,0,0,1. Good.\nRow 4: 0,1,0,1. Good.\n\nColumns:\n\nColumn 1: 0,1,1,0. The two 1s in the middle. Allowed.\nColumn 2: 1,0,0,1. Two 0s. Allowed.\nColumn 3: 1,1,0,0. Two 1s, two 0s. Allowed.\nColumn 4: 0,0,1,1. Two 0s, two 1s. Allowed.\n\nSo all good.\n\nNow let's check Option B:\n\nOption B:\n1 1 1 0\n1 0 1 0\n1 0 0 1\n0 1 0 1\n\nFirst, check Rule 3: Each row and column must have two 0s and two 1s.\n\nRow 1: 1,1,1,0 → three 1s and one 0. That's not equal. So Rule 3 is violated. So Option B is invalid.\n\nWait, but before I proceed, maybe I should check all rules just in case, but since Rule 3 is already violated, no need. So Option B is out.\n\nOption C:\n\nOption C:\n0 1 1 0\n1 0 1 0\n1 0 1 1\n0 1 0 1\n\nCheck Rule 3: Each row and column must have two 0s and two 1s.\n\nCheck each row:\n\nRow 1: 0,1,1,0 → two 0s, two 1s. Good.\nRow 2: 1,0,1,0 → same. Good.\nRow 3: 1,0,1,1 → three 1s, one 0. Not equal. So Rule 3 is violated. Therefore, Option C is invalid.\n\nOption D:\n\nOption D:\n0 1 1 0\n1 0 1 0\n1 0 0 1\n0 1 0 0\n\nCheck Rule 3: Each row and column must have two 0s and two 1s.\n\nCheck each row:\n\nRow 1: 0,1,1,0 → two 0s, two 1s. Good.\nRow 2: 1,0,1,0 → same. Good.\nRow 3: 1,0,0,1 → two 0s, two 1s. Good.\nRow 4: 0,1,0,0 → three 0s, one 1. Not equal. So Rule 3 is violated. Therefore, Option D is invalid.\n\nSo, from the above, only Option A satisfies all rules.

Each row and column must have an equal number of 0s and 1s. Also, no two rows or columns can be identical.\n\nAlright, the puzzle is 4x4, so each row and column must have exactly two 0s and two 1s. That's because 4 cells with equal numbers mean two each. Also, no identical rows or columns, so each row must be unique, and each column must be unique as well.\n\nNow, let me look at each option one by one.\n\nStarting with Option A:\n```\n0 0 1 1\n0 1 0 1\n1 0 1 0\n1 1 0 0\n```\n\nLet me check each row for the two 0s and two 1s.\n\nRow 1: 0,0,1,1.

Each row should not have three in a row.\n\nRow 1: 0,0,1,1. So, two 0s, then two 1s. No three in a row. Good.\nRow 2: 0,1,0,1. Alternating, so no problem.\nRow 3: 1,0,1,0. Same as row 2, alternating. Good.\nRow 4: 1,1,0,0. Two 1s, then two 0s. No three. Good.\n\nNow, check columns for same issues.\n\nColumn 1: 0,0,1,1. So, two 0s, then two 1s. No three in a row. Good.\nColumn 2: 0,1,0,1. Alternating, good.\nColumn 3: 1,0,1,0. Alternating, good.\nColumn 4: 1,1,0,0. Two 1s, then two 0s. Good.\n\nNow, check if any rows are identical.

Each cell is either a 0 or a 1, and there are specific rules I have to follow.\n\nFirst, let me go through the rules again to make sure I understand them:\n\n1. Each cell must be 0 or 1. That's straightforward.\n2. No more than two consecutive identical numbers in any row or column. So, sequences like 000 or 111 are not allowed. That means in any row or column, after two same numbers, the next one must be different.\n3. Each row and column must have an equal number of 0s and 1s. Since it's a 4x4 grid, each row and column must have exactly two 0s and two 1s.\n4. No two rows can be identical, and no two columns can be identical. So, all rows must be unique, and all columns must be unique.\n\nAlright, with that in mind, let me look at each option one by one and check if they satisfy all the rules.\n\nStarting with Option A:\n```\n1 0 0 1\n1 1 0 0\n0 1 1 0\n0 0 1 1\n```\n\nLet me check each row first.\n\nRow 1: 1 0 0 1\n- Consecutive 0s: two at the second and third positions. That's allowed because it's exactly two, not three. So rule 2 is satisfied.\n- Number of 0s and 1s: two 0s and two 1s. Good.\n- Uniqueness: I'll check later after looking at all rows.\n\nRow 2: 1 1 0 0\n- Consecutive 1s: two at the beginning, then two 0s. Both are allowed as two in a row.\n- Count: two 1s and two 0s. Good.\n\nRow 3: 0 1 1 0\n- Consecutive 1s: two in the middle. Allowed.\n- Count: two 0s and two 1s. Good.\n\nRow 4: 0 0 1 1\n- Consecutive 0s and 1s: each has two. Allowed.\n- Count: two 0s and two 1s. Good.\n\nNow, checking the columns.\n\nColumn 1:\n1,1,0,0\n- Consecutive 1s: two at the top. Allowed.\n- 0s: two at the bottom. Allowed.\n- Count: two 1s and two 0s. Good.\n\nColumn 2:\n0,1,1,0\n- Consecutive 1s: two in the middle. Allowed.\n- Count: two 0s and two 1s. Good.\n\nColumn 3:\n0,0,1,1\n- Consecutive 0s: two at the top. Allowed.\n- 1s: two at the bottom. Allowed.\n- Count: two 0s and two 1s. Good.\n\nColumn 4:\n1,0,0,1\n- Consecutive 0s: two in the middle. Allowed.\n- Count: two 0s and two 1s. Good.\n\nNow, uniqueness of rows and columns. Looking at the rows:\n\nRow 1: 1 0 0 1\nRow 2: 1 1 0 0\nRow 3: 0 1 1 0\nRow 4: 0 0 1 1\n\nAll four rows are different.

So uniqueness is satisfied.\n\nSo Option A seems to satisfy all the rules. But I shouldn't jump to conclusions yet; I need to check all options.\n\nMoving on to Option B:\n```\n0 0 0 1\n1 1 0 0\n0 1 1 0\n0 0 1 1\n```\n\nFirst, check each row.\n\nRow 1: 0 0 0 1\n- Consecutive 0s: three at the beginning. That violates rule 2 because you can't have more than two in a row. So this row is invalid.\n\nTherefore, Option B is invalid. I can eliminate B right away.\n\nOption C:\n```\n1 0 0 1\n1 1 0 0\n0 1 0 0\n0 0 1 1\n```\n\nChecking rows first.\n\nRow 1: 1 0 0 1\n- Consecutive 0s: two. Allowed.\n- Count: two 0s, two 1s. Good.\n\nRow 2: 1 1 0 0\n- Consecutive 1s: two. Allowed.\n- Count: two 0s, two 1s. Good.\n\nRow 3: 0 1 0 0\n- Consecutive 0s: two at the end. Allowed.\n- Count: three 0s and one 1. Wait, that's three 0s and one 1. That violates rule 3 because each row must have two 0s and two 1s. So this row is invalid.\n\nTherefore, Option C is invalid. I can eliminate C.\n\nOption D:\n```\n1 0 0 1\n1 1 0 0\n0 1 1 0\n0 0 1 0\n```\n\nChecking rows.\n\nRow 1: 1 0 0 1\n- Consecutive 0s: two. Allowed.\n- Count: two 0s, two 1s.

Good.\n\nRow 4: 0 0 1 0\n- Consecutive 0s: two at the beginning, then a 1, then a 0. So only two 0s in a row, allowed.\n- Count: three 0s and one 1. That's a problem. It has three 0s and one 1, which violates rule 3. So this row is invalid.\n\nTherefore, Option D is invalid.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me recount Row 4 of Option D: 0,0,1,0.\n\nThat's 0,0,1,0. So 0 appears three times, and 1 appears once. So yes, three 0s. That's invalid.\n\nSo D is invalid.\n\nSo, the only option that satisfies all the rules is Option A.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me double-check Option A's columns.\n\nColumn 1: 1,1,0,0\n- Consecutive 1s: two at the top. Allowed.\n- Count: two 1s, two 0s. Good.\n\nColumn 2: 0,1,1,0\n- Consecutive 1s: two in the middle. Allowed.\n- Count: two 0s, two 1s. Good.\n\nColumn 3: 0,0,1,1\n- Consecutive 0s: two at the top. Allowed.\n- Count: two 0s, two 1s. Good.\n\nColumn 4: 1,0,0,1\n- Consecutive 0s: two in the middle. Allowed.\n- Count: two 0s, two 1s. Good.\n\nAnd all rows and columns are unique, as I saw earlier. So Option A is valid.\n\nJust to make sure, maybe I should check for any other possible issues. Sometimes, even if each row and column individually satisfy the rules, there might be something else, but in this case, since each row and column meets the criteria and the uniqueness is maintained, I think it's safe.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is Option A.\n</think>\n\nThe correct answer is \\boxed{A}.", "ground_truth": "A", "prompt": "You need to solve a Binairo puzzle (Size: 4x4).You need to solve a Binairo puzzle.\n\n**Binairo Puzzle Rules:**\n1.

{"question_id": "binairo_715", "response": "Okay, so I have to solve this Binairo puzzle, and there are four options to choose from: A, B, C, or D. Each option is a 4x4 grid with 0s and 1s. Let me go through each rule step by step to check which option is correct.\n\nFirst, let me recall the rules:\n\n1. Each cell must be 0 or 1. That's straightforward; I'll check if any option has something other than 0 or 1, but looking at the options, they all seem to comply.\n\n2. No more than two consecutive identical numbers in any row or column. So, I need to make sure that in every row and column, there are no sequences like 000 or 111. I'll have to check each row and column for this.\n\n3. Each row and column must have an equal number of 0s and 1s. Since it's a 4x4 grid, each row and column should have exactly two 0s and two 1s. So, I need to count the 0s and 1s in each row and column for every option.\n\n4. No two rows can be identical, and no two columns can be identical. So, each row should be unique, and each column should be unique as well.\n\nAlright, let me start by checking each option one by one.\n\n**Option A:**\n```\n1 1 0 0\n1 0 0 1\n0 0 1 1\n0 1 1 0\n```\n\nLet me check each row:\n\n1. Row 1: 1,1,0,0. No more than two consecutive same numbers. Good.\n   - Count: two 1s and two 0s. Okay.\n2. Row 2: 1,0,0,1. No three in a row. Good.\n   - Count: two 1s and two 0s. Okay.\n3. Row 3: 0,0,1,1. No three in a row. Good.\n   - Count: two 0s and two 1s. Okay.\n4. Row 4: 0,1,1,0. No three in a row. Good.\n   - Count: two 0s and two 1s. Okay.\n\nNow, check for identical rows. Let's see:\n\nRow 1: 1,1,0,0\nRow 2: 1,0,0,1\nRow 3: 0,0,1,1\nRow 4: 0,1,1,0\n\nAll rows are different. Good.\n\nNow, check columns:\n\nColumn 1: 1,1,0,0\n- No three in a row.

No three in a row. Good.\n   - Count: three 0s and one 1. Oh, that's a problem. It should have two 0s and two 1s.

Each cell must be either 0 or 1.\n2. No more than two consecutive identical numbers in any row or column. So, no three in a row like 000 or 111.\n3.

All cells are 0 or 1. That's fine.\n2. Check for consecutive identical numbers:\n   - Row 1: 0,0,1,1. So, two 0s and two 1s, each appearing twice in a row. That's okay because the rule says no more than two consecutive. So, two is allowed.\n   - Row 2: 0,1,1,0. There are two 1s in the middle but no more than two, so good.\n   - Row 3: 1,1,0,0. Same as row 1, which is acceptable.\n   - Row 4: 1,0,0,1. Two 0s in the middle, which is allowed.\n   \n   Now, columns:\n   - Column 1: 0,0,1,1. Two 0s followed by two 1s. Consecutive counts are two each, which is fine.\n   - Column 2: 0,1,1,0. Two 1s in the middle, okay.\n   - Column 3: 1,1,0,0. Two 1s, then two 0s. Fine.\n   - Column 4: 1,0,0,1.

Wait, that's two 0s and two 1s.\n     - Row 3: two 1s, two 0s.\n     - Row 4: one 1, two 0s, one 1.

All cells are 0 or 1. Good.\n2. Consecutive identical numbers:\n   - Row 1: 1,0,1,1. The last two are 1s, which is allowed.\n   - Row 2: 0,1,1,0. Two 1s in the middle, okay.\n   - Row 3: 1,1,0,0.

Oh, that's three 1s in a row, which violates rule 3 because it needs exactly two 0s and two 1s.\n     \n   Wait, hold on. Let me recount:\n   Row 1: 1,0,1,1. So, 1 appears three times, 0 once. That's three 1s, which is more than two. So, this violates rule 3.\n\nSo, Option B is invalid because row 1 has three 1s and only one 0. Therefore, I can eliminate Option B.\n\n**Option C:**\n```\n0 0 1 1\n0 1 1 0\n1 1 1 0\n1 0 0 1\n```\n\nChecking rules.\n\n1. All cells are 0 or 1. Good.\n2.

That's a violation of rule 2, which says no more than two consecutive identical numbers.\n   \n   So, already, Option C is invalid because of three consecutive 1s in row 3. So I can eliminate Option C.\n\n**Option D:**\n```\n0 0 1 1\n0 1 1 0\n1 1 0 0\n1 0 0 0\n```\n\nChecking the rules.\n\n1. All cells are 0 or 1. Good.\n2. Consecutive identical numbers:\n   - Row 1: 0,0,1,1. Two each, okay.\n   - Row 2: 0,1,1,0. Two 1s, okay.\n   - Row 3: 1,1,0,0. Two 1s, two 0s. Fine.\n   - Row 4: 1,0,0,0. Wait, here we have three 0s at the end. That's three consecutive 0s, which violates rule 2.\n   \n   So, Option D is invalid due to three consecutive 0s in row 4.\n\nTherefore, after checking all options, only Option A satisfies all the rules. Let me just double-check Option A once more to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nRechecking Option A:\n- Rows: All have two 0s and two 1s, no three in a row. Columns: same. No identical rows or columns.

{"question_id": "binairo_1370", "response": "Alright, so I've got this Binairo puzzle to solve, and I need to figure out which of the four options (A, B, C, D) is the correct one. Let me start by recalling the rules of Binairo to make sure I don't miss anything.\n\nFirst, each cell must be either a 0 or a 1. That's straightforward. The second rule says there can be no more than two consecutive identical numbers in any row or column. So, I can't have three 0s or three 1s in a row or column. Got it.\n\nThird, each row and column must have an equal number of 0s and 1s. Since it's a 6x6 grid, each row and column must have exactly three 0s and three 1s. That's important because it means every row and column is balanced.\n\nFourth, no two rows can be identical, and no two columns can be identical either. So, I have to check that all rows are unique and all columns are unique.\n\nAlright, so I need to check each option against these rules. Let me start with Option A.\n\n**Option A:**\n\nRow 1: 1 1 0 0 1 0\nLet me check for consecutive duplicates. There's 1,1 which is okay since it's two. Then 0,0, which is also okay. Then 1,0. No three in a row, so rule 2 is satisfied. Also, count of 1s: let's see, 1,1,1,0,0,0. Wait, that's three 1s and three 0s. Wait, actually, in row 1: 1,1,0,0,1,0. So, 1 appears three times, 0 appears three times. Good.\n\nRow 2: 1 0 0 1 1 0\nConsecutive: 0,0 is okay. Then 1,1 is okay. The rest are alternating. So, that's fine. Counts: 1 appears three times, 0 appears three times. Good.\n\nRow 3: 0 0 1 1 0 1\nConsecutive: 0,0 and 1,1. No three in a row. Counts: three 0s and three 1s. Good.\n\nRow 4: 0 1 0 0 1 1\nConsecutive: 0,1,0,0,1,1. Here, the last two are 1,1, which is okay. No three. Counts: 0s and 1s each three. Good.\n\nRow 5: 1 0 1 1 0 0\nConsecutive: 1,0,1,1,0,0. 1,1 and 0,0. No three. Counts: three 1s and three 0s. Good.\n\nRow 6: 0 1 1 0 0 1\nConsecutive: 1,1 is okay, 0,0 is okay. No three. Counts: three each. Good.\n\nSo, all rows in Option A satisfy rules 2 and 3. Now, are all rows unique? Let's see:\n\nRow1: 1 1 0 0 1 0\nRow2: 1 0 0 1 1 0\nRow3: 0 0 1 1 0 1\nRow4: 0 1 0 0 1 1\nRow5: 1 0 1 1 0 0\nRow6: 0 1 1 0 0 1\n\nLooking at these, each row seems different. For example, Row1 starts with two 1s, Row2 starts with 1,0,0, etc. So, no duplicates in rows.\n\nNow, check columns. Each column must also have three 0s and three 1s, and no duplicates. Let's check each column.\n\nColumn1: 1,1,0,0,1,0\nLet me list them: 1,1,0,0,1,0. So, 1 appears three times, 0 appears three times. Good.\n\nColumn2:1,0,0,1,0,1\n1,0,0,1,0,1. 1 appears three times, 0 appears three times. Good.\n\nColumn3:0,0,1,0,1,1\n0,0,1,0,1,1. 0 appears three times, 1 appears three times. Good.\n\nColumn4:0,1,1,0,1,0\n0,1,1,0,1,0. 0 appears three times, 1 appears three times. Good.\n\nColumn5:1,1,0,1,0,0\n1,1,0,1,0,0. 1 appears three times, 0 appears three times. Good.\n\nColumn6:0,0,1,1,0,1\n0,0,1,1,0,1. 0 appears three times, 1 appears three times. Good.\n\nSo, all columns in Option A satisfy rule 3. Now, are all columns unique?\n\nColumn1: 1,1,0,0,1,0\nColumn2:1,0,0,1,0,1\nColumn3:0,0,1,0,1,1\nColumn4:0,1,1,0,1,0\nColumn5:1,1,0,1,0,0\nColumn6:0,0,1,1,0,1\n\nLooking at these, each column seems different. For example, Column1 starts with two 1s, Column2 starts with 1,0,0, etc. So, no duplicates in columns. Therefore, Option A satisfies all rules.\n\nBut before I conclude, let me check the other options to make sure there isn't another correct one or if I missed something in A.\n\n**Option B:**\n\nLet me check it similarly.\n\nRow1:0 1 0 0 1 0\nConsecutive: 0,1,0,0,1,0. 0,0 is okay. 1,1 is not present. So, rule 2 is satisfied. Counts: 0s: 1,0,0,0,1,0. Wait, wait, let's count.\n\nRow1: 0,1,0,0,1,0. So, 0 appears at positions 1,3,4,6: that's four 0s. 1 appears at positions 2,5: two 1s. Oh, that's a problem. Each row must have three 0s and three 1s. So, this row violates rule 3. Therefore, Option B is invalid. I can eliminate B.\n\n**Option C:**\n\nRow1:1 1 0 0 1 0\nSame as Option A's Row1. So, okay.\n\nRow2:1 0 0 1 1 0\nSame as A's Row2. Okay.\n\nRow3:0 0 1 1 0 1\nSame as A's Row3. Okay.\n\nRow4:0 1 0 1 1 1\nWait, let's check this row: 0,1,0,1,1,1. Here, the last three are 1,1,1. That's three 1s in a row, which violates rule 2. So, Option C is invalid.\n\nAlso, let's check the counts. Row4: 0,1,0,1,1,1. So, 0s: 3, 1s: 3. But because of the three consecutive 1s, it's invalid.\n\nSo, Option C is out.\n\n**Option D:**\n\nRow1:1 1 0 0 1 0\nSame as A's Row1. Okay.\n\nRow2:1 0 0 1 1 0\nSame as A's Row2. Okay.\n\nRow3:0 0 1 1 0 1\nSame as A's Row3. Okay.\n\nRow4:0 1 0 0 1 1\nSame as A's Row4. Okay.\n\nRow5:1 0 1 1 0 0\nSame as A's Row5. Okay.\n\nRow6:0 1 1 0 0 0\nWait, Row6: 0,1,1,0,0,0. Let's check consecutive: 1,1 is okay, 0,0,0 at the end. That's three 0s in a row, which violates rule 2. So, Option D is invalid.\n\nAlso, check counts: Row6 has four 0s and two 1s, which violates rule 3 as well.\n\nSo, Option D is invalid.\n\nWait, but I should also check if the rows and columns in D have duplicates. Since I found a row that's invalid, I can stop checking.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's look at Option D's columns.\n\nColumn6:0,0,1,1,0,0.\n\nSo, 0,0,1,1,0,0. 0 appears four times, which is more than three. So, that's another violation.\n\nSo, Option D is out.\n\nSo, after checking all options, only Option A satisfies all the rules. Therefore, the correct answer must be A.\n\nBut wait, just to be extra careful, let me double-check Option A's columns for duplicates. Earlier, I thought they were all unique, but maybe I missed something.\n\nColumn1:1,1,0,0,1,0\nColumn2:1,0,0,1,0,1\nColumn3:0,0,1,0,1,1\nColumn4:0,1,1,0,1,0\nColumn5:1,1,0,1,0,0\nColumn6:0,0,1,1,0,1\n\nLooking at these, each column has a different pattern. For example, Column1 starts with two 1s, Column2 starts with 1,0,0, Column3 starts with two 0s, etc. So, no duplicates.\n\nAdditionally, all rows in A are unique, as we saw earlier.\n\nTherefore, Option A is the correct solution.\n</think>\n\nThe correct answer is Option A because it satisfies all the Binairo rules: no more than two consecutive identical numbers, equal numbers of 0s and 1s in each row and column, and all rows and columns are unique. \n\n\\boxed{A}", "ground_truth": "A", "prompt": "You need to solve a Binairo puzzle (Size: 6x6).You need to solve a Binairo puzzle.\n\n**Binairo Puzzle Rules:**\n1.

{"question_id": "binairo_1074", "response": "Okay, so I've got this Binairo puzzle to solve, and I need to figure out which of the four options (A, B, C, D) is the correct solution. Let me first make sure I understand the rules properly because that's super important for solving it correctly.\n\nBinairo rules, as given, are:\n\n1. Each cell must be 0 or 1.\n2. No more than two consecutive identical numbers in any row or column. So, sequences like 000 or 111 are forbidden.\n3. Each row and column must have an equal number of 0s and 1s. Since it's a 4x4 grid, that means each row and column must have exactly two 0s and two 1s.\n4. No two rows can be identical, and no two columns can be identical either.\n\nAlright, so I need to check each option against these rules.\n\nLet me list out the options again for clarity.\n\nOption A:\n0 1 1 0\n0 1 0 1\n1 0 1 0\n1 0 0 1\n\nOption B:\n1 1 1 0\n0 1 0 1\n1 0 1 0\n1 0 0 1\n\nOption C:\n0 1 1 0\n0 1 0 1\n1 0 0 0\n1 0 0 1\n\nOption D:\n0 1 1 0\n0 1 0 1\n1 0 1 0\n1 0 0 0\n\nNow, I'll go through each option one by one, checking each rule.\n\nStarting with Option A.\n\n**Checking Option A:**\n\nFirst, check each row for consecutive numbers.\n\nRow 1: 0 1 1 0\n- Consecutive 1s: two in a row. That's allowed because the rule says no more than two. So that's okay.\n\nRow 2: 0 1 0 1\n- Alternating 0s and 1s. No consecutive duplicates, so good.\n\nRow 3: 1 0 1 0\n- Same as row 2, alternating. Good.\n\nRow 4: 1 0 0 1\n- Consecutive 0s: two in a row. Allowed. So, each row passes the consecutive rule.\n\nNext, check the count of 0s and 1s in each row.\n\nRow 1: two 0s and two 1s. Good.\nRow 2: two 0s and two 1s. Good.\nRow 3: two 0s and two 1s. Good.\nRow 4: two 0s and two 1s. Good.\n\nNow, check if any rows are identical.\n\nLooking at rows:\n\nRow 1: 0 1 1 0\nRow 2: 0 1 0 1\nRow 3: 1 0 1 0\nRow 4: 1 0 0 1\n\nAll rows are different. So rule 4 is satisfied for rows.\n\nNow, check the columns for consecutive numbers and counts.\n\nColumn 1:\n0\n0\n1\n1\n- So, 0,0,1,1. The first two are 0s, which is two consecutive. That's allowed. The next two are 1s, also two consecutive, allowed.\n\nColumn 2:\n1\n1\n0\n0\n- Similarly, two 1s followed by two 0s. Allowed.\n\nColumn 3:\n1\n0\n1\n0\n- Alternating. No consecutive duplicates. Good.\n\nColumn 4:\n0\n1\n0\n1\n- Alternating. Good.\n\nNow, check the counts in each column.\n\nColumn 1: two 0s and two 1s. Good.\nColumn 2: two 1s and two 0s. Good.\nColumn 3: two 1s and two 0s. Good.\nColumn 4: two 0s and two 1s. Good.\n\nNow, check if any columns are identical.\n\nLooking at the columns:\n\nColumn 1: 0,0,1,1\nColumn 2: 1,1,0,0\nColumn 3: 1,0,1,0\nColumn 4: 0,1,0,1\n\nAll columns are different. So rule 4 is satisfied for columns.\n\nSo, Option A passes all the rules. But let me check the other options just to make sure there isn't another correct one or if I missed something.\n\n**Checking Option B:**\n\nFirst, let's check the rows for consecutive numbers.\n\nRow 1: 1 1 1 0\n- Here, we have three 1s in a row. That's not allowed because the rule says no more than two consecutive. So this row violates rule 2.\n\nSince it already fails, we can skip the other checks for Option B. But for thoroughness, let's check if any other issues arise.\n\nRow 2: 0 1 0 1\n- Good.\n\nRow 3: 1 0 1 0\n- Good.\n\nRow 4: 1 0 0 1\n- Good.\n\nBut because Row 1 is invalid, Option B is out.\n\n**Checking Option C:**\n\nStarting with the rows.\n\nRow 1: 0 1 1 0\n- Two 1s in a row, allowed.\n\nRow 2: 0 1 0 1\n- Good.\n\nRow 3: 1 0 0 0\n- Here, three 0s at the end. That's three consecutive 0s, which violates rule 2.\n\nSo, Option C is invalid because Row 3 has three 0s in a row. Let's check other rows quickly.\n\nRow 4: 1 0 0 1\n- Two 0s, allowed.\n\nBut since Row 3 is invalid, Option C is out.\n\n**Checking Option D:**\n\nLet's check the rows.\n\nRow 1: 0 1 1 0\n- Two 1s, allowed.\n\nRow 2: 0 1 0 1\n- Good.\n\nRow 3: 1 0 1 0\n- Good.\n\nRow 4: 1 0 0 0\n- Three 0s at the end. That's invalid, same as in Option C.\n\nSo, Option D is invalid because Row 4 has three 0s.\n\nWait a second, actually, in Option D, Row 4 is 1 0 0 0. So, the last three are 0s, which is three consecutive 0s. So, yes, it's invalid.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the counts as well, just to be thorough.\n\nIn Option D, each row:\n\nRow 1: two 0s, two 1s. Good.\n\nRow 2: two 0s, two 1s. Good.\n\nRow 3: two 0s, two 1s. Good.\n\nRow 4: three 0s and one 1. That's three 0s and one 1, which violates rule 3 because each row must have two 0s and two 1s. So, actually, that's another problem beyond the consecutive issue.\n\nSo, Option D is invalid on two counts: consecutive 0s and incorrect count in a row.\n\nTherefore, after going through all options, only Option A satisfies all the rules.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me re-examine Option A's columns. Because sometimes when I'm tired, I might miss something.\n\nLooking again at Option A's columns:\n\nColumn 1: 0, 0, 1, 1. So, two 0s followed by two 1s. That's allowed because each pair is two consecutive.\n\nBut wait, the rule is no more than two consecutive identical numbers. So, two is okay, but three is not.\n\nIn Option A, the first column has two 0s and two 1s. The same with the second column: two 1s and two 0s.\n\nBut wait, the first column is 0,0,1,1. So, the first two are 0s, then the next two are 1s. That's allowed because each pair is exactly two.\n\nSame with the second column: 1,1,0,0.\n\nSo, no three in a row anywhere.\n\nSimilarly, other columns are alternating, so no issues.\n\nSo, Option A is good.\n\nWait, but let me check the column counts again.\n\nEach column in Option A:\n\nColumn 1: two 0s, two 1s. Correct.\n\nColumn 2: two 1s, two 0s. Correct.\n\nColumn 3: two 1s, two 0s. Correct.\n\nColumn 4: two 0s, two 1s. Correct.\n\nSo, all columns satisfy the count rule.\n\nAlso, all columns are unique. Column 1 is 0,0,1,1; Column 2 is 1,1,0,0; Column 3 is 1,0,1,0; Column 4 is 0,1,0,1. All different.\n\nTherefore, Option A satisfies all the rules.\n\nWait, but I just noticed something. In Option A, Row 4 is 1,0,0,1. So, the last two are 0,1. So, no three in a row, just two 0s. Wait, no, in Row 4: 1,0,0,1.\n\nSo, positions 3 and 4 are 0 and 1, but before that, position 2 is 0, so position 2 and 3 are both 0. So, two 0s in a row. That's allowed.\n\nSo, no three in a row anywhere.\n\nTherefore, I think Option A is correct.\n\nWait, but I just thought of another thing. Let me check for any possible duplicates in columns or rows beyond what I did before.\n\nIn Option A, rows are:\n\nRow 1: 0 1 1 0\n\nRow 2: 0 1 0 1\n\nRow 3: 1 0 1 0\n\nRow 4: 1 0 0 1\n\nAll rows are different. So, no duplicates there.\n\nColumns:\n\nColumn 1: 0,0,1,1\n\nColumn 2: 1,1,0,0\n\nColumn 3: 1,0,1,0\n\nColumn 4: 0,1,0,1\n\nAll columns are different. So, no duplicates there either.\n\nTherefore, Option A passes all the rules.\n\nWait, but I just noticed that in Option A, Row 4 is 1 0 0 1, which ends with a 1, and the previous cell is 0, so it's 0 followed by 1. So, no issue.\n\nI think I've checked everything thoroughly. So, the correct answer is Option A.\n</think>\n\nThe correct answer is Option A, as it satisfies all the Binairo puzzle rules without any violations.\n\n\\boxed{A}", "ground_truth": "A", "prompt": "You need to solve a Binairo puzzle (Size: 4x4).You need to solve a Binairo puzzle.\n\n**Binairo Puzzle Rules:**\n1.

No more than two consecutive identical numbers in any row or column.\n3. Each row and column must have an equal number of 0s and 1s. Since it's a 4x4 grid, each row and column should have exactly two 0s and two 1s.\n4.

Two 1s in a row (positions 2 and 3). That's allowed because two consecutive are okay, but not three. So this row is fine.\n- Row 2: 0,0,1,1. Two 0s at the start, which is fine. Then two 1s, also fine.\n- Row 3: 1,0,0,1. Two 0s in the middle, okay.\n- Row 4: 1,1,0,0. Two 1s, then two 0s, okay.\n\nNow, columns:\n\n- Column 1: 0,0,1,1. Two 0s, then two 1s. That's okay.\n- Column 2: 1,0,0,1. Two 0s in the middle, okay.\n- Column 3: 1,1,0,0. Two 1s, then two 0s, okay.\n- Column 4: 0,1,1,0. Two 1s in the middle, okay.\n\nNow, check for equal number of 0s and 1s in each row and column.\n\nEach row in Option A has two 0s and two 1s. Same for each column.

So rule 4 is satisfied.\n\nNow, check rule 2: no more than two consecutive identical numbers.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n- Row 1: 0,1,1,0 → 1,1 is two, okay.\n- Row 2: 0,0,1,1 → 0,0 and 1,1, both two, okay.\n- Row 3: 1,0,0,1 → 0,0, okay.\n- Row 4: 1,1,0,0 → 1,1 and 0,0, okay.\n\nColumns:\n\n- Column 1: 0,0,1,1 → 0,0 and 1,1, okay.\n- Column 2: 1,0,0,1 → 0,0, okay.\n- Column 3: 1,1,0,0 → 1,1 and 0,0, okay.\n- Column 4: 0,1,1,0 → 1,1, okay.\n\nSo, Option A seems to satisfy all the rules.

Oh no, that violates rule 2. So Option C is invalid.\n\n**Option D:**\n```\n0 1 1 0\n0 0 1 1\n1 0 0 1\n1 1 0 1\n```\n\nCheck rows:\n\n- Row 1: 0,1,1,0 → okay.\n- Row 2: 0,0,1,1 → okay.\n- Row 3: 1,0,0,1 → okay.\n- Row 4: 1,1,0,1 → has two 1s at the start, then 0,1. Wait, in row 4, is there any three consecutive?

So column 4 is 0,1,1,1. That's three 1s at the end. So that violates rule 2. So Option D is invalid.\n\nWait, let me check column 4 again. It's the fourth column of each row:\n\n- Row 1: 0\n- Row 2: 1\n- Row 3: 1\n- Row 4: 1\n\nSo, column 4: 0,1,1,1. That's three 1s in a column, which is not allowed.

{"question_id": "binairo_397", "response": "Okay, so I've got this Binairo puzzle to solve, and there are four options to choose from: A, B, C, and D. I remember that Binairo has specific rules, so I need to go through each option carefully to see which one fits all the criteria. Let me jot down the rules again to make sure I don't miss anything.\n\n1. Each cell must be either 0 or 1. Well, that's straightforward—looking at all options, they all use only 0s and 1s, so that's covered.\n\n2. No more than two consecutive identical numbers in any row or column. So, I need to check each row and column for any occurrence of three 0s or 1s in a row.\n\n3. Each row and column must have an equal number of 0s and 1s. Since it's a 6x6 grid, each row and column should have exactly three 0s and three 1s.\n\n4. No two rows can be identical, and no two columns can be identical. So, I need to ensure that all rows are unique and all columns are unique.\n\nAlright, let's tackle each rule one by one for each option.\n\nStarting with Option A:\n\nOption A:\n0 0 1 0 1 1\n1 1 0 1 0 0\n0 1 0 0 1 1\n0 0 1 1 0 1\n1 0 1 1 0 0\n1 1 0 0 1 0\n\nFirst, checking for consecutive numbers:\n\nRow 1: 0 0 1 0 1 1\n- The first two are 0s, then 1, then 0, then 1, and ends with two 1s. So, there are two 1s at the end. That's okay because it's only two. So no three in a row.\n\nRow 2: 1 1 0 1 0 0\n- Starts with two 1s, then 0, then 1, 0, and ends with two 0s. Again, only two consecutive, so fine.\n\nRow 3: 0 1 0 0 1 1\n- 0,1,0, then two 0s—wait, the third and fourth are 0s, so that's two in a row. No three, so okay. Then 1,1 at the end. Also fine.\n\nRow 4: 0 0 1 1 0 1\n- Two 0s, two 1s, then 0,1. All good.\n\nRow 5: 1 0 1 1 0 0\n- 1,0,1, then two 1s, 0, and two 0s. Only two consecutive, so okay.\n\nRow 6: 1 1 0 0 1 0\n- Two 1s, two 0s, 1,0. No three in a row.\n\nNow, columns:\n\nColumn 1: 0,1,0,0,1,1\n- 0,1,0,0—two 0s. Then 1,1—two 1s. So, okay.\n\nColumn 2: 0,1,1,0,0,1\n- 0,1,1—two 1s. Then 0,0—two 0s. Then 1. So okay.\n\nColumn 3: 1,0,0,1,1,0\n- 1,0,0—two 0s. Then 1,1—two 1s. Then 0. So okay.\n\nColumn 4: 0,1,0,1,1,0\n- 0,1,0,1,1—two 1s. Then 0. So okay.\n\nColumn 5: 1,0,1,0,0,1\n- 1,0,1,0,0—two 0s. Then 1. So okay.\n\nColumn 6: 1,0,1,1,0,0\n- 1,0,1,1—two 1s. Then 0,0—two 0s. So okay.\n\nAlright, so no row or column has three in a row. Good.\n\nNext, checking if each row and column has three 0s and three 1s.\n\nFor rows:\n\nRow 1: 0,0,1,0,1,1 → counts: 3 zeros and 3 ones. Good.\n\nRow 2: 1,1,0,1,0,0 → same. 3 and 3.\n\nRow 3: 0,1,0,0,1,1 → 3 and 3.\n\nRow 4: 0,0,1,1,0,1 → 3 zeros? Let's count: positions 1,2,5 are 0s. So three 0s and three 1s. Yes.\n\nRow 5: 1,0,1,1,0,0 → 3 zeros (positions 2,5,6) and three 1s. Good.\n\nRow 6: 1,1,0,0,1,0 → 3 zeros (positions 3,4,6) and three 1s. Perfect.\n\nColumns:\n\nColumn 1: 0,1,0,0,1,1 → 0s: 3 (positions 1,3,4), 1s: 3. Good.\n\nColumn 2: 0,1,1,0,0,1 → 0s: 3 (positions 1,4,5), 1s: 3. Good.\n\nColumn 3: 1,0,0,1,1,0 → 0s: 3 (positions 2,3,6), 1s: 3. Good.\n\nColumn 4: 0,1,0,1,1,0 → 0s: 3 (positions 1,3,6), 1s: 3. Good.\n\nColumn 5: 1,0,1,0,0,1 → 0s: 3 (positions 2,4,5), 1s: 3. Good.\n\nColumn 6: 1,0,1,1,0,0 → 0s: 3 (positions 2,5,6), 1s: 3. Good.\n\nAlright, all rows and columns have equal numbers of 0s and 1s.\n\nNow, checking for uniqueness of rows and columns.\n\nLooking at rows:\n\nRow 1: 0 0 1 0 1 1\n\nRow 2: 1 1 0 1 0 0\n\nRow 3: 0 1 0 0 1 1\n\nRow 4: 0 0 1 1 0 1\n\nRow 5: 1 0 1 1 0 0\n\nRow 6: 1 1 0 0 1 0\n\nAre any of these rows identical?\n\nLooking at them:\n\nRow 1: starts with 0,0.\n\nRow 2: starts with 1,1.\n\nRow 3: 0,1.\n\nRow 4: 0,0.\n\nWait, Row 1 and Row 4 both start with 0,0, but let's see the entire row.\n\nRow 1: 0 0 1 0 1 1\n\nRow 4: 0 0 1 1 0 1\n\nThey have the same first three elements: 0,0,1, but then differ. So they are different.\n\nSimilarly, Row 2 and Row 5:\n\nRow 2: 1 1 0 1 0 0\n\nRow 5: 1 0 1 1 0 0\n\nNot identical because the third element is 0 vs 1.\n\nRow 6: 1 1 0 0 1 0\n\nNo other row is the same as this.\n\nSo all rows are unique.\n\nNow, columns. Each column must be unique.\n\nLooking at the columns:\n\nColumn 1: 0,1,0,0,1,1\n\nColumn 2: 0,1,1,0,0,1\n\nColumn 3: 1,0,0,1,1,0\n\nColumn 4: 0,1,0,1,1,0\n\nColumn 5: 1,0,1,0,0,1\n\nColumn 6: 1,0,1,1,0,0\n\nAre any of these columns identical?\n\nLooking at Column 1: 0,1,0,0,1,1\n\nColumn 2: 0,1,1,0,0,1\n\nThey both start with 0,1, but then differ. So different.\n\nColumn 3: 1,0,0,1,1,0\n\nColumn 4: 0,1,0,1,1,0\n\nDifferent starting elements.\n\nColumn 5: 1,0,1,0,0,1\n\nColumn 6: 1,0,1,1,0,0\n\nLooking at Columns 5 and 6:\n\nColumn 5: 1,0,1,0,0,1\n\nColumn 6: 1,0,1,1,0,0\n\nThey have the same first three elements: 1,0,1, but then Column 5 has 0,0,1, while Column 6 has 1,0,0. So they are different.\n\nSo all columns are unique.\n\nSo Option A seems to satisfy all the rules. But let me check the other options just to be sure.\n\nOption B:\n\n1 0 1 0 1 1\n\n1 1 0 1 0 0\n\n0 1 0 0 1 1\n\n0 0 1 1 0 1\n\n1 0 1 1 0 0\n\n1 1 0 0 1 0\n\nWait, looking at Option B, the first row is 1 0 1 0 1 1.\n\nLet me check if this has three in a row.\n\n1 0 1 0 1 1: ends with two 1s. That's okay.\n\nBut looking at the entire grid, I should check all rows and columns.\n\nBut before that, let me check the counts for rows.\n\nRow 1: 1,0,1,0,1,1 → counts: 3 ones and 3 zeros? Let's see: 1,0,1,0,1,1. So, four 1s and two 0s. Wait, that's not equal. So that's a problem.\n\nEach row must have exactly three 0s and three 1s. So Row 1 in Option B has four 1s and two 0s. That violates rule 3. So Option B is invalid. So I can eliminate B immediately.\n\nMoving on to Option C:\n\n0 0 1 0 1 1\n\n1 1 0 1 0 0\n\n0 1 0 0 1 1\n\n0 0 1 0 0 1\n\n1 0 1 1 0 0\n\n1 1 0 0 1 0\n\nFirst, checking rows for counts:\n\nRow 1: 0,0,1,0,1,1 → three 0s and three 1s. Good.\n\nRow 2: 1,1,0,1,0,0 → three 1s and three 0s. Good.\n\nRow 3: 0,1,0,0,1,1 → same. Good.\n\nRow 4: 0,0,1,0,0,1 → Let's count: 0s are positions 1,2,4,5 → four 0s. 1s are positions 3,6 → two 1s. Oh, that's a problem. It has four 0s and two 1s. So this row violates rule 3. Therefore, Option C is invalid.\n\nSo Option C is out.\n\nNow, Option D:\n\n0 0 1 0 1 1\n\n1 1 0 1 0 0\n\n0 1 0 0 1 1\n\n0 0 1 1 0 1\n\n1 0 1 1 0 0\n\n1 1 0 0 1 1\n\nFirst, check the counts for rows:\n\nRow 1: 0,0,1,0,1,1 → three 0s and three 1s. Good.\n\nRow 2: 1,1,0,1,0,0 → same. Good.\n\nRow 3: 0,1,0,0,1,1 → same. Good.\n\nRow 4: 0,0,1,1,0,1 → Let's count: 0s at positions 1,2,5 → three 0s. 1s at positions 3,4,6 → three 1s. Good.\n\nRow 5: 1,0,1,1,0,0 → 1s at positions 1,3,4 → three. 0s at 2,5,6 → three. Good.\n\nRow 6: 1,1,0,0,1,1 → 1s at positions 1,2,5,6 → four 1s. 0s at 3,4 → two. So, this row has four 1s and two 0s. That's a violation of rule 3. So Option D is invalid.\n\nSo, from the four options, only Option A passes all the checks. Let me just quickly recap to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nIn Option A, all rows and columns have three 0s and three 1s, no three consecutive same numbers, and all rows and columns are unique. So it satisfies all the rules.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is Option A.\n</think>\n\nThe correct answer is Option A as it satisfies all the Binairo puzzle rules without any violations.\n\n\\boxed{A}", "ground_truth": "A", "prompt": "You need to solve a Binairo puzzle (Size: 6x6).You need to solve a Binairo puzzle.\n\n**Binairo Puzzle Rules:**\n1.

{"question_id": "binairo_808", "response": "Okay, so I've got this Binairo puzzle to solve, and I need to figure out which of the four options (A, B, C, D) is the correct solution. Let me start by recalling the rules to make sure I don't miss anything.\n\nFirst, each cell must be either 0 or 1. That's straightforward. Second, no more than two consecutive identical numbers in any row or column. So, I can't have three 0s or three 1s in a row or column. Third, each row and column must have an equal number of 0s and 1s. Since it's a 4x4 grid, that means each row and column should have exactly two 0s and two 1s. Lastly, no two rows can be identical, and no two columns can be identical either.\n\nAlright, let me go through each option one by one, checking these rules.\n\nStarting with Option A:\n\nOption A:\n0 0 1 1\n1 0 0 1\n1 1 0 0\n0 1 1 0\n\nLet me check each row first for consecutive numbers and the count of 0s and 1s.\n\nRow 1: 0,0,1,1. Consecutive 0s at the start, that's two in a row, which is allowed. Then two 1s, also allowed. So no more than two in a row. Counts: two 0s, two 1s. Good.\n\nRow 2: 1,0,0,1. Here, the first number is 1, then 0,0. That's two 0s in a row, which is fine. Then 1. Counts: two 0s, two 1s. Okay.\n\nRow 3: 1,1,0,0. Two 1s, then two 0s. All within the limit. Counts: two each. Good.\n\nRow 4: 0,1,1,0. Two 1s in the middle. That's allowed. Counts: two 0s, two 1s. Okay.\n\nNow, checking columns for the same.\n\nColumn 1: 0,1,1,0. Let's see: 0,1, then 1,0. So, the two 1s are consecutive, which is allowed. No three in a row. Counts: two 0s, two 1s. Fine.\n\nColumn 2: 0,0,1,1. Two 0s, then two 1s. That's allowed. Counts: two each. Good.\n\nColumn 3: 1,0,0,1. Two 0s in the middle. Allowed. Counts: two 1s, two 0s. Okay.\n\nColumn 4: 1,1,0,0. Two 1s, then two 0s. Allowed. Counts: two each. Good.\n\nNext, checking if any rows are identical. Looking at the rows:\n\nRow 1: 0,0,1,1\n\nRow 2: 1,0,0,1\n\nRow 3: 1,1,0,0\n\nRow 4: 0,1,1,0\n\nNone of these are the same. Each row is unique.

So Option A seems to satisfy all the rules.\n\nBut wait, let me check the other options just to be sure.\n\nOption B:\n\n1 0 1 1\n\n1 0 0 1\n\n1 1 0 0\n\n0 1 1 0\n\nChecking rows first.\n\nRow 1: 1,0,1,1. Here, the last two are 1s, which is allowed. Counts: three 1s? Wait, no, let's count. 1,0,1,1. That's three 1s in the row? Wait, no, it's 1,0,1,1. So positions 1,3,4 are 1s. That's three 1s in the row. Wait, but the rule says no more than two consecutive. So the last two 1s are consecutive, which is okay, but the total number in the row is three 1s and one 0. So the row has three 1s, which violates rule 3 because each row must have two 0s and two 1s. So Option B is invalid because row 1 has three 1s and only one 0. So I can eliminate Option B.\n\nMoving on to Option C:\n\n0 0 1 1\n\n1 0 0 1\n\n1 1 1 0\n\n0 1 1 0\n\nLet me check the rows.\n\nRow 1: 0,0,1,1. Two 0s, two 1s. Allowed. Good.\n\nRow 2: 1,0,0,1. Two 0s, two 1s. Allowed. Good.\n\nRow 3: 1,1,1,0. Oh, here we have three 1s in a row, which violates the consecutive rule. Also, the count of 1s is three and 0s is one, which violates the equal number rule. So Option C is invalid.\n\nNow, Option D:\n\n0 0 1 1\n\n1 0 0 1\n\n1 1 0 0\n\n0 1 1 1\n\nChecking rows.\n\nRow 1: 0,0,1,1. Good.\n\nRow 2: 1,0,0,1. Good.\n\nRow 3: 1,1,0,0. Good.\n\nRow 4: 0,1,1,1. Here, the last three are 1s. That's three consecutive 1s, which violates the rule. So Option D is invalid.\n\nSo, from this, only Option A satisfies all the rules. Let me double-check Option A again to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nRows:\n\nEach row has exactly two 0s and two 1s, no three in a row. All rows are unique.\n\nColumns:\n\nEach column also has two 0s and two 1s, no three in a row.

Let me start by recalling the rules to make sure I don't miss anything.\n\nFirst off, each cell must be either a 0 or a 1. That's straightforward. The second rule is that there can't be more than two consecutive identical numbers in any row or column. So, no three 0s or 1s in a row. Thirdly, each row and column must have an equal number of 0s and 1s. Since it's a 6x6 grid, each row and column should have exactly three 0s and three 1s. Lastly, no two rows can be identical, and same for columns.\n\nOkay, so I need to check each option against these rules. Let me go through each option one by one, starting with Option A.\n\n**Option A:**\n```\n0 1 1 0 1 0\n1 1 0 1 0 0\n1 0 0 1 0 1\n0 0 1 0 1 1\n0 1 0 1 1 0\n1 0 1 0 0 1\n```\n\nLet me check each row for consecutive numbers. \n\nFirst row: 0 1 1 0 1 0. There are two 1s in a row, which is allowed. No three in a row, so that's good. Similarly, the other rows don't seem to have three in a row. Now, checking each row's count of 0s and 1s. Each row should have three 0s and three 1s.\n\nFirst row: 0,1,1,0,1,0. That's three 0s and three 1s. Good.\n\nSecond row: 1,1,0,1,0,0. Again, three 0s and three 1s. \n\nThird row: 1,0,0,1,0,1. Three 0s and three 1s.\n\nFourth row: 0,0,1,0,1,1. Hmm, two 0s at the start. Wait, no, let's count. 0,0,1,0,1,1. So that's three 0s and three 1s. Okay.\n\nFifth row: 0,1,0,1,1,0. Three 0s and three 1s.\n\nSixth row: 1,0,1,0,0,1. Three 0s and three 1s.\n\nSo all rows are good on the count. Now, check for identical rows. All rows look different. For example, row 1 is 0 1 1 0 1 0, row 2 is 1 1 0 1 0 0, which is different, and so on. So no identical rows.\n\nNow, check columns. Let me go column by column.\n\nColumn 1: 0,1,1,0,0,1. Let's see, are there more than two consecutive same numbers? 0,1,1,0,0,1. So, two 1s, then two 0s. That's okay. The count: how many 0s and 1s? 0 appears three times (positions 1,4,5), and 1 appears three times (positions 2,3,6). Good.\n\nColumn 2: 1,1,0,0,1,0. Consecutive 1s: two, which is fine. Then two 0s, also fine. Count: 1 appears three times (positions 1,2,5), 0 appears three times (positions 3,4,6). Good.\n\nColumn 3: 1,0,0,1,0,1. Consecutive 0s: two, okay. Count: three 0s and three 1s. Good.\n\nColumn 4: 0,1,1,0,1,0. Consecutive 1s: two, okay. Count: three 0s and three 1s. Good.\n\nColumn 5: 1,0,0,1,1,0. Consecutive 0s: two, then two 1s. Count: three 0s and three 1s. Good.\n\nColumn 6: 0,0,1,1,0,1. Consecutive 0s: two, then two 1s. Count: three 0s and three 1s. Good.\n\nSo far, Option A seems to satisfy all the rules. But let me check the other options just to make sure there isn't another correct one or if I missed something in A.\n\n**Option B:**\n```\n1 1 1 0 1 0\n1 1 0 1 0 0\n1 0 0 1 0 1\n0 0 1 0 1 1\n0 1 0 1 1 0\n1 0 1 0 0 1\n```\n\nLooking at the first row: 1,1,1,0,1,0. Oh, that's three 1s in a row, which violates the second rule. So Option B is invalid right away. So I can eliminate B.\n\n**Option C:**\n```\n0 1 1 0 1 0\n1 1 0 1 0 0\n1 0 0 1 0 1\n0 0 1 1 1 1\n0 1 0 1 1 0\n1 0 1 0 0 1\n```\n\nLooking at the fourth row: 0,0,1,1,1,1. Here, there are four 1s in a row at the end. That's more than two, which violates rule 2. So Option C is invalid. So I can eliminate C.\n\n**Option D:**\n```\n0 1 1 0 1 0\n1 1 0 1 0 0\n1 0 0 1 0 1\n0 0 1 0 1 1\n0 1 0 1 1 0\n1 0 1 0 0 0\n```\n\nLooking at the sixth row: 1,0,1,0,0,0. There are three 0s at the end. That's three in a row, which violates rule 2. So Option D is invalid. So D is out.\n\nWait, but let me double-check Option D. The sixth row is 1,0,1,0,0,0. So positions 5 and 6 are 0s, but position 4 is 0 as well. So from positions 4,5,6: 0,0,0. That's three in a row, which is definitely not allowed. So D is invalid.\n\nSo, after checking all options, only Option A satisfies all the rules.

{"question_id": "binairo_1156", "response": "Okay, so I have this Binairo puzzle to solve, and there are four options to choose from: A, B, C, or D. I need to figure out which one is the correct solution based on the rules provided. Let me start by recalling the rules because I need to make sure each option adheres to all of them.\n\nFirst, each cell must be either a 0 or a 1. That's straightforward, and looking at all the options, they all seem to have only 0s and 1s. So that rule is satisfied by all.\n\nSecond, no more than two consecutive identical numbers in any row or column. So, I need to check each row and column for any occurrence of three in a row. That's a key rule because it's easy to overlook, and it's one of the main constraints in Binairo.\n\nThird, each row and column must contain an equal number of 0s and 1s. Since the grid is 6x6, each row and column should have exactly three 0s and three 1s. So, I need to count the number of 0s and 1s in each row and column for each option.\n\nFourth, no two rows can be identical, and no two columns can be identical either. So, I need to check for duplicate rows and columns across all options.\n\nAlright, let's go through each option one by one, starting with Option A.\n\n**Option A:**\n\nLet's write down the rows:\n\nRow 1: 0 1 1 0 0 1  \nRow 2: 0 1 0 1 0 1  \nRow 3: 1 0 0 1 1 0  \nRow 4: 1 0 1 0 0 1  \nRow 5: 0 1 0 1 1 0  \nRow 6: 1 0 1 0 1 0  \n\nFirst, checking for consecutive numbers. Let's look at each row.\n\nRow 1: 0,1,1,0,0,1. There are two 1s in a row (positions 2 and 3) and two 0s in a row (positions 4 and 5). That's okay because it's only two consecutive, which is allowed. So, no issues here.\n\nRow 2: 0,1,0,1,0,1. This alternates perfectly, so no consecutive duplicates. Good.\n\nRow 3: 1,0,0,1,1,0. Here, positions 2 and 3 have two 0s, and positions 4 and 5 have two 1s. Both are okay.\n\nRow 4: 1,0,1,0,0,1. Positions 4 and 5 have two 0s. Fine.\n\nRow 5: 0,1,0,1,1,0. Positions 4 and 5 have two 1s. Okay.\n\nRow 6: 1,0,1,0,1,0. Alternates, so no consecutive duplicates.\n\nNow, checking the columns for consecutive duplicates. Let's look at each column:\n\nColumn 1: 0,0,1,1,0,1. Let's see: 0,0 is two, then 1,1 is two. Wait, actually, in column 1, the first two are 0s, so that's two in a row, which is allowed. Then next two are 1s (positions 3 and 4), also allowed. Then 0,1: no issue. So column 1 is fine.\n\nColumn 2: 1,1,0,0,1,0. Similarly, two 1s, then two 0s, then 1,0. Allowed.\n\nColumn 3: 1,0,0,1,0,1. Here, positions 2 and 3 are two 0s. That's okay.\n\nColumn 4: 0,1,1,0,1,0. Positions 2 and 3: two 1s. Allowed.\n\nColumn 5: 0,0,1,0,1,1. First two 0s, then 1,0,1,1. Wait, the last two in column 5 are 1s (positions 5 and 6). So two 1s at the end. Allowed.\n\nColumn 6: 1,1,0,1,0,0. First two 1s, then 0,1,0,0. The last two 0s are allowed.\n\nSo, all columns are fine in terms of consecutive duplicates.\n\nNext, check if each row and column has three 0s and three 1s.\n\nFor rows:\n\nRow 1: Let's count 0s and 1s. 0 appears at positions 1,4,5: three 0s. 1s at 2,3,6: three 1s. Good.\n\nRow 2: 0s at 1,3,5: three. 1s at 2,4,6: three. Good.\n\nRow 3: 0s at 2,3,6: three. 1s at 1,4,5: three. Good.\n\nRow 4: 0s at 2,5,6: three. 1s at 1,3,4: three. Good.\n\nRow 5: 0s at 1,3,6: three. 1s at 2,4,5: three. Good.\n\nRow 6: 0s at 2,4,6: three. 1s at 1,3,5: three. Good.\n\nAll rows have three 0s and three 1s.\n\nNow columns:\n\nColumn 1: 0,0,1,1,0,1. Count 0s: positions 1,2,5: three. 1s: positions 3,4,6: three. Good.\n\nColumn 2: 1,1,0,0,1,0. 0s at 3,4,6: three. 1s at 1,2,5: three. Good.\n\nColumn 3: 1,0,0,1,0,1. 0s at 2,3,5: three. 1s at 1,4,6: three. Good.\n\nColumn 4: 0,1,1,0,1,0. 0s at 1,4,6: three. 1s at 2,3,5: three. Good.\n\nColumn 5: 0,0,1,0,1,1. 0s at 1,2,4: three. 1s at 3,5,6: three. Good.\n\nColumn 6: 1,1,0,1,0,0. 0s at 3,5,6: three. 1s at 1,2,4: three. Good.\n\nSo all columns are balanced as well.\n\nNow, check for duplicate rows. Looking at the rows:\n\nRow 1: 0 1 1 0 0 1  \nRow 2: 0 1 0 1 0 1  \nRow 3: 1 0 0 1 1 0  \nRow 4: 1 0 1 0 0 1  \nRow 5: 0 1 0 1 1 0  \nRow 6: 1 0 1 0 1 0  \n\nI don't see any duplicates here. Each row is unique.\n\nNow, checking columns for duplicates. Since each column is 6 cells, we need to see if any two columns are identical.\n\nLet's list the columns as sequences:\n\nColumn 1: 0,0,1,1,0,1  \nColumn 2: 1,1,0,0,1,0  \nColumn 3: 1,0,0,1,0,1  \nColumn 4: 0,1,1,0,1,0  \nColumn 5: 0,0,1,0,1,1  \nColumn 6: 1,1,0,1,0,0  \n\nLooking at these:\n\n- Column 1: 0,0,1,1,0,1\n- Column 2: 1,1,0,0,1,0\n- Column 3: 1,0,0,1,0,1\n- Column 4: 0,1,1,0,1,0\n- Column 5: 0,0,1,0,1,1\n- Column 6: 1,1,0,1,0,0\n\nComparing Column 1 and Column 4: 0,0,1,1,0,1 vs. 0,1,1,0,1,0. Not the same.\n\nColumn 2 vs. Column 5: 1,1,0,0,1,0 vs. 0,0,1,0,1,1. Not the same.\n\nColumn 3 vs. Column 6: 1,0,0,1,0,1 vs. 1,1,0,1,0,0. Not the same.\n\nNo duplicates among columns either. So, Option A satisfies all the rules. Hmm, but wait, let me check the other options as well because sometimes there might be multiple correct ones, but the user says there is a right answer, so maybe only one is correct.\n\n**Option B:**\n\nLooking at Option B:\n\nRow 1: 1 1 1 0 0 1  \nRow 2: 0 1 0 1 0 1  \nRow 3: 1 0 0 1 1 0  \nRow 4: 1 0 1 0 0 1  \nRow 5: 0 1 0 1 1 0  \nRow 6: 1 0 1 0 1 0  \n\nFirst, check for consecutive duplicates in rows.\n\nRow 1: 1,1,1 at the start. That's three 1s in a row. That's not allowed. So, Option B is invalid because it violates rule 2.\n\nSo, I can eliminate Option B immediately.\n\n**Option C:**\n\nRows:\n\nRow 1: 0 1 1 0 0 1  \nRow 2: 0 1 0 1 0 1  \nRow 3: 1 0 0 1 1 0  \nRow 4: 1 0 1 1 0 1  \nRow 5: 0 1 0 1 1 0  \nRow 6: 1 0 1 0 1 0  \n\nChecking rows for consecutive duplicates.\n\nRow 1: 0,1,1,0,0,1. Two 1s and two 0s: okay.\n\nRow 2: Alternating: okay.\n\nRow 3: 1,0,0,1,1,0. Two 0s and two 1s: okay.\n\nRow 4: 1,0,1,1,0,1. Here, positions 3 and 4 are two 1s: okay.\n\nWait, no, positions 3 and 4: 1,1? So that's two 1s, which is allowed.\n\nWait, let me check: 1,0,1,1,0,1. So, yes, two 1s in a row. Allowed.\n\nRow 5: 0,1,0,1,1,0. Two 1s at the end: okay.\n\nRow 6: Alternating: okay.\n\nNow, checking columns for consecutive duplicates.\n\nColumn 1: 0,0,1,1,0,1. Let's see: two 0s, two 1s: okay.\n\nColumn 2: 1,1,0,0,1,0. Two 1s, two 0s: okay.\n\nColumn 3: 1,0,0,1,1,0. Two 0s, two 1s: okay.\n\nColumn 4: 0,1,1,0,1,0. Two 1s: okay.\n\nColumn 5: 0,0,1,0,1,1. Two 0s, two 1s: okay.\n\nColumn 6: 1,1,0,1,0,0. Two 1s, two 0s: okay.\n\nSo, columns are fine.\n\nNow, check row counts:\n\nRow 1: 0s at 1,4,5: three. 1s at 2,3,6: three. Good.\n\nRow 2: 0s at 1,3,5: three. 1s at 2,4,6: three. Good.\n\nRow 3: 0s at 2,3,6: three. 1s at 1,4,5: three. Good.\n\nRow 4: Let's count: 1,0,1,1,0,1. 0s at 2 and 5: only two. Wait, that's a problem. 0s are at positions 2 and 5, so two 0s. 1s are at 1,3,4,6: four 1s. That's unequal. So, this row doesn't have three 0s and three 1s. Therefore, Option C is invalid.\n\nWait, but looking back, Row 4: 1,0,1,1,0,1. So, 0s are at 2 and 5: two 0s. 1s are at 1,3,4,6: four 1s. So, the counts are 2 and 4. That violates rule 3. So, Option C is invalid.\n\n**Option D:**\n\nRows:\n\nRow 1: 0 1 1 0 0 1  \nRow 2: 0 1 0 1 0 1  \nRow 3: 1 0 0 1 1 0  \nRow 4: 1 0 1 0 0 1  \nRow 5: 0 1 0 1 1 0  \nRow 6: 1 0 1 0 1 1  \n\nFirst, checking for consecutive duplicates.\n\nRow 1: 0,1,1,0,0,1. Two 1s, two 0s: okay.\n\nRow 2: Alternating: okay.\n\nRow 3: 1,0,0,1,1,0. Two 0s, two 1s: okay.\n\nRow 4: 1,0,1,0,0,1. Two 0s: okay.\n\nRow 5: 0,1,0,1,1,0. Two 1s: okay.\n\nRow 6: 1,0,1,0,1,1. Two 1s at the end: okay.\n\nNow, columns:\n\nColumn 1: 0,0,1,1,0,1. Two 0s, two 1s: okay.\n\nColumn 2: 1,1,0,0,1,0. Two 1s, two 0s: okay.\n\nColumn 3: 1,0,0,1,1,0. Two 0s, two 1s: okay.\n\nColumn 4: 0,1,1,0,1,0. Two 1s: okay.\n\nColumn 5: 0,0,1,0,1,1. Two 0s, two 1s: okay.\n\nColumn 6: 1,1,0,1,0,1. Two 1s at the start, and then 0,1,1. Wait, in Column 6: positions 1 and 2 are 1s, then 0, then 1, 0, 1. So, three 1s in total? Let me count the 1s and 0s in Column 6:\n\nColumn 6: 1,1,0,1,0,1. So, 1s are at positions 1,2,4,6: four 1s. 0s at 3 and 5: two 0s. So, that's four 1s and two 0s. That violates rule 3 because each column must have three 0s and three 1s. Therefore, Option D is invalid.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Column 6: 1,1,0,1,0,1.\n\nNumber of 1s: 1,2,4,6: four. 0s: 3,5: two. So yes, it's unbalanced. Therefore, Option D is invalid.\n\nSo, going back, the only valid option so far is Option A. But let me just recheck Option A to be thorough.\n\nIn Option A, all rows have three 0s and three 1s, all columns do as well. No consecutive triples, no duplicate rows or columns. So, it seems correct.\n\nWait, but looking back at Option C, I thought Row 4 had two 0s and four 1s. Let me confirm:\n\nOption C, Row 4: 1,0,1,1,0,1. So, 0s are at positions 2 and 5: two. 1s are at 1,3,4,6: four. Yes, that's unbalanced. So, definitely invalid.\n\nOption D: Column 6 is unbalanced, as we saw.\n\nSo, after checking all options, only Option A satisfies all the rules. Therefore, the answer should be A.\n\nBut hold on, in the initial analysis of Option A, I thought it was correct, but I want to make sure there are no duplicates in rows or columns. Let me list out the rows again for Option A:\n\nRow 1: 0 1 1 0 0 1  \nRow 2: 0 1 0 1 0 1  \nRow 3: 1 0 0 1 1 0  \nRow 4: 1 0 1 0 0 1  \nRow 5: 0 1 0 1 1 0  \nRow 6: 1 0 1 0 1 0  \n\nAre any of these rows duplicates? Let me compare each:\n\nRow 1 vs Row 2: Different.  \nRow 1 vs Row 3: Different.  \nRow 1 vs Row 4: Different.  \nRow 1 vs Row 5: Different.  \nRow 1 vs Row 6: Different.  \n\nRow 2 vs Row 3: Different.  \nRow 2 vs Row 4: Different.  \nRow 2 vs Row 5: Different.  \nRow 2 vs Row 6: Different.  \n\nRow 3 vs Row 4: Different.  \nRow 3 vs Row 5: Different.  \nRow 3 vs Row 6: Different.  \n\nRow 4 vs Row 5: Different.  \nRow 4 vs Row 6: Different.  \n\nRow 5 vs Row 6: Different.  \n\nSo, no duplicate rows. Now columns:\n\nColumn 1: 0,0,1,1,0,1  \nColumn 2: 1,1,0,0,1,0  \nColumn 3: 1,0,0,1,0,1  \nColumn 4: 0,1,1,0,1,0  \nColumn 5: 0,0,1,0,1,1  \nColumn 6: 1,1,0,1,0,0  \n\nAre any of these columns duplicates? Let me check each pair:\n\nColumn 1 vs Column 2: Different.  \nColumn 1 vs Column 3: Different.  \nColumn 1 vs Column 4: Different.  \nColumn 1 vs Column 5: Different.  \nColumn 1 vs Column 6: Different.  \n\nColumn 2 vs Column 3: Different.  \nColumn 2 vs Column 4: Different.  \nColumn 2 vs Column 5: Different.  \nColumn 2 vs Column 6: Different.  \n\nColumn 3 vs Column 4: Different.  \nColumn 3 vs Column 5: Different.  \nColumn 3 vs Column 6: Different.  \n\nColumn 4 vs Column 5: Different.  \nColumn 4 vs Column 6: Different.  \n\nColumn 5 vs Column 6: Different.  \n\nSo, no duplicate columns either.\n\nTherefore, Option A is the only one that satisfies all the rules, so the answer is A.\n</think>\n\nThe correct answer is Option A, as it adheres to all Binairo rules without any violations.\n\n\\boxed{A}", "ground_truth": "A", "prompt": "You need to solve a Binairo puzzle (Size: 6x6).You need to solve a Binairo puzzle.\n\n**Binairo Puzzle Rules:**\n1.

{"question_id": "binairo_1197", "response": "Okay, so I need to solve this Binairo puzzle, which is a 6x6 grid. The rules are a bit specific, so I need to make sure I understand them clearly before diving in. Let me recap the rules:\n\n1. Each cell must be either 0 or 1. That's straightforward.\n2. No more than two consecutive identical numbers in any row or column. So, I can't have three 0s or three 1s in a row or column.\n3. Each row and column must have an equal number of 0s and 1s. Since it's a 6x6 grid, each row and column must have exactly three 0s and three 1s.\n4. No two rows can be identical, and no two columns can be identical. So, each row must be unique, and each column must be unique.\n\nAlright, the options given are A, B, C, D. I need to check each one to see if it satisfies all the rules.\n\nLet me start by examining each option step by step.\n\n**Option A:**\n```\n0 0 1 1 0 1\n0 1 0 0 1 1\n1 0 1 0 1 0\n0 1 0 1 0 1\n1 1 0 0 1 0\n1 0 1 1 0 0\n```\n\nLet me check each rule.\n\nFirst, each cell is 0 or 1. That's satisfied.\n\nSecond, check for no more than two consecutive identical numbers.\n\nLooking at the first row: 0 0 1 1 0 1. There are two 0s followed by two 1s. So, two in a row is allowed. The rest are alternating. So, that's okay.\n\nSecond row: 0 1 0 0 1 1. Let's see: 0, then 1, then 0, then two 0s? Wait, no, 0,1,0,0,1,1. So from position 3 to 4, it's 0 followed by 0. That's two consecutive 0s, which is allowed. Then from 5 to 6, it's 1 followed by 1, which is two consecutive 1s, allowed. So that's okay.\n\nThird row: 1 0 1 0 1 0. All alternating, no consecutive duplicates. Good.\n\nFourth row: 0 1 0 1 0 1. Same as above, alternating. Good.\n\nFifth row: 1 1 0 0 1 0. Let's see: two 1s at the start, allowed. Then two 0s, allowed. Then 1,0. So, okay.\n\nSixth row: 1 0 1 1 0 0. Let's check: 1,0,1,1,0,0. So, two 1s in the middle, allowed. Two 0s at the end, allowed. So that's okay.\n\nNow, check each column for the same.\n\nFirst column: 0,0,1,0,1,1. Let's see: two 0s at the top, allowed. Then 1,0,1,1. So, no more than two in a row anywhere. So that's okay.\n\nSecond column: 0,1,0,1,1,0. Let's see: 0,1,0,1,1,0. There's a 1 followed by another 1, which is two, allowed. The rest are alternating. So that's okay.\n\nThird column: 1,0,1,0,0,1. Let's see: 1,0,1,0,0,1. Two 0s at the end, allowed. The rest are alternating. Good.\n\nFourth column: 1,0,0,1,0,1. Let's see: 1,0,0,1,0,1. Two 0s in the middle, allowed. The rest are alternating. Good.\n\nFifth column: 0,1,1,0,1,0. 0,1,1,0,1,0. Two 1s in the middle, allowed. The rest are alternating. Good.\n\nSixth column: 1,1,0,1,0,0. Let's see: 1,1,0,1,0,0. Two 1s at the top, allowed. Then two 0s at the bottom, allowed. So that's okay.\n\nSo, all rows and columns satisfy the second rule.\n\nThird rule: Each row and column must have three 0s and three 1s.\n\nLet me count for each row in Option A:\n\nRow 1: 0,0,1,1,0,1 → 4 ones and 2 zeros. Wait, that's not equal. So that's a problem. Because in a 6-cell row, it needs to have exactly three 0s and three 1s. So, Row 1 has four 1s and two 0s. That violates rule 3. Therefore, Option A is invalid.\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\nRow 1: 0,0,1,1,0,1.\n\nNumber of 0s: positions 1,2,5 → three 0s.\n\nNumber of 1s: positions 3,4,6 → three 1s. Wait, that's correct. Hmm, maybe I miscounted earlier.\n\nWait, 0,0,1,1,0,1: 0,0,1,1,0,1. Let's count:\n\n0s: 1,2,5 → three.\n\n1s: 3,4,6 → three. So, actually, it's balanced. So, I must have miscounted earlier.\n\nLet me check again:\n\nRow 1: 0,0,1,1,0,1 → 0 appears at positions 1,2,5 → three times. 1 appears at positions 3,4,6 → three times. So, it's okay.\n\nSimilarly, check Row 2: 0,1,0,0,1,1.\n\n0s: 1,3,4 → three.\n\n1s: 2,5,6 → three. So, okay.\n\nRow 3: 1,0,1,0,1,0 → three 1s and three 0s.\n\nRow 4: same as Row 3, same counts.\n\nRow 5: 1,1,0,0,1,0 → 1s at 1,2,5; 0s at 3,4,6. So, three each.\n\nRow 6: 1,0,1,1,0,0 → 1s at 1,3,4; 0s at 2,5,6. So, three each.\n\nSo, all rows have three 0s and three 1s. Good.\n\nNow, check columns.\n\nColumn 1: 0,0,1,0,1,1 → 0s at 1,2,4; 1s at 3,5,6. Three each.\n\nColumn 2: 0,1,0,1,1,0 → 0s at 1,3,6; 1s at 2,4,5. Three each.\n\nColumn 3: 1,0,1,0,0,1 → 1s at 1,3,6; 0s at 2,4,5. Three each.\n\nColumn 4: 1,0,0,1,0,1 → 1s at 1,4,6; 0s at 2,3,5. Three each.\n\nColumn 5: 0,1,1,0,1,0 → 0s at 1,4,6; 1s at 2,3,5. Three each.\n\nColumn 6: 1,1,0,1,0,0 → 1s at 1,2,4; 0s at 3,5,6. Three each.\n\nSo, all columns have three 0s and three 1s. Good.\n\nFourth rule: No two rows can be identical, and no two columns can be identical.\n\nLooking at Option A's rows:\n\nRow 1: 0 0 1 1 0 1\n\nRow 2: 0 1 0 0 1 1\n\nRow 3: 1 0 1 0 1 0\n\nRow 4: 0 1 0 1 0 1\n\nRow 5: 1 1 0 0 1 0\n\nRow 6: 1 0 1 1 0 0\n\nAre any of these rows identical? Let me compare each pair.\n\nRow 1 vs Row 2: Different.\n\nRow 1 vs Row 3: Different.\n\nRow 1 vs Row 4: Different.\n\nRow 1 vs Row 5: Different.\n\nRow 1 vs Row 6: Different.\n\nRow 2 vs Row 3: Different.\n\nRow 2 vs Row 4: Different.\n\nRow 2 vs Row 5: Different.\n\nRow 2 vs Row 6: Different.\n\nRow 3 vs Row 4: Different.\n\nRow 3 vs Row 5: Different.\n\nRow 3 vs Row 6: Different.\n\nRow 4 vs Row 5: Different.\n\nRow 4 vs Row 6: Different.\n\nRow 5 vs Row 6: Different.\n\nSo, all rows are unique.\n\nNow, columns:\n\nLooking at each column's sequence.\n\nColumn 1: 0,0,1,0,1,1\n\nColumn 2: 0,1,0,1,1,0\n\nColumn 3: 1,0,1,0,0,1\n\nColumn 4: 1,0,0,1,0,1\n\nColumn 5: 0,1,1,0,1,0\n\nColumn 6: 1,1,0,1,0,0\n\nAre any columns identical?\n\nCompare Column 1 and Column 2: Different.\n\nColumn 1 and Column 3: Different.\n\nColumn 1 and Column 4: Different.\n\nColumn 1 and Column 5: Different.\n\nColumn 1 and Column 6: Different.\n\nColumn 2 and Column 3: Different.\n\nColumn 2 and Column 4: Different.\n\nColumn 2 and Column 5: Different.\n\nColumn 2 and Column 6: Different.\n\nColumn 3 and Column 4: Different.\n\nColumn 3 and Column 5: Different.\n\nColumn 3 and Column 6: Different.\n\nColumn 4 and Column 5: Different.\n\nColumn 4 and Column 6: Different.\n\nColumn 5 and Column 6: Different.\n\nSo, all columns are unique.\n\nSo, Option A satisfies all the rules. Hmm, but let me check the other options to make sure.\n\n**Option B:**\n```\n1 0 1 1 0 1\n0 1 0 0 1 1\n1 0 1 0 1 0\n0 1 0 1 0 1\n1 1 0 0 1 0\n1 0 1 1 0 0\n```\n\nFirst, check rows for three 0s and three 1s.\n\nRow 1: 1,0,1,1,0,1. Let's count 1s: positions 1,3,4,6 → four 1s. 0s: positions 2,5 → two 0s. So, four 1s and two 0s. That violates rule 3. So, Option B is invalid.\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\nRow 1: 1,0,1,1,0,1.\n\n1s: 1,3,4,6 → four.\n\n0s: 2,5 → two. So, yes, that's unequal. Therefore, Option B is invalid.\n\nSo, I can eliminate B.\n\n**Option C:**\n```\n0 0 1 1 0 1\n0 1 0 0 1 1\n1 0 1 0 1 0\n0 1 0 0 0 1\n1 1 0 0 1 0\n1 0 1 1 0 0\n```\n\nCheck rows for three 0s and three 1s.\n\nRow 1: 0,0,1,1,0,1 → three 0s (positions 1,2,5), three 1s (3,4,6). Okay.\n\nRow 2: 0,1,0,0,1,1 → 0s at 1,3,4; 1s at 2,5,6. Okay.\n\nRow 3: 1,0,1,0,1,0 → three each. Okay.\n\nRow 4: 0,1,0,0,0,1 → 0s at 1,3,4,5 → four 0s. 1s at 2,6 → two. So, unequal. Therefore, Row 4 is invalid. So, Option C is invalid.\n\n**Option D:**\n```\n0 0 1 1 0 1\n0 1 0 0 1 1\n1 0 1 0 1 0\n0 1 0 1 0 1\n1 1 0 0 1 0\n1 0 1 1 0 1\n```\n\nFirst, check rows for three 0s and three 1s.\n\nRow 1: 0,0,1,1,0,1 → three 0s, three 1s. Okay.\n\nRow 2: 0,1,0,0,1,1 → three 0s, three 1s. Okay.\n\nRow 3: 1,0,1,0,1,0 → three each. Okay.\n\nRow 4: 0,1,0,1,0,1 → three 0s, three 1s. Okay.\n\nRow 5: 1,1,0,0,1,0 → three 1s (1,2,5), three 0s (3,4,6). Okay.\n\nRow 6: 1,0,1,1,0,1 → 1s at 1,3,4,6 → four 1s. 0s at 2,5 → two. So, unequal. Therefore, Row 6 is invalid. So, Option D is invalid.\n\nSo, from the above, only Option A and Option B were possible, but Option B had a row with unequal counts, and Option C and D had invalid rows as well.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought Option A was valid, but let me double-check the columns for uniqueness.\n\nWait, in Option A, all rows are unique, as I checked before. Let me check columns again.\n\nOption A's columns:\n\nColumn 1: 0,0,1,0,1,1 → sequence: 0,0,1,0,1,1.\n\nColumn 2: 0,1,0,1,1,0 → 0,1,0,1,1,0.\n\nColumn 3: 1,0,1,0,0,1 → 1,0,1,0,0,1.\n\nColumn 4: 1,0,0,1,0,1 → 1,0,0,1,0,1.\n\nColumn 5: 0,1,1,0,1,0 → 0,1,1,0,1,0.\n\nColumn 6: 1,1,0,1,0,0 → 1,1,0,1,0,0.\n\nAre any of these columns identical?\n\nLooking at Column 1 and Column 3: Column 1 is 0,0,1,0,1,1; Column 3 is 1,0,1,0,0,1. Different.\n\nColumn 1 and Column 5: Column 1 is 0,0,1,0,1,1; Column 5 is 0,1,1,0,1,0. Different.\n\nColumn 1 and Column 6: 0,0,1,0,1,1 vs 1,1,0,1,0,0. Different.\n\nColumn 2 and Column 4: 0,1,0,1,1,0 vs 1,0,0,1,0,1. Different.\n\nColumn 2 and Column 5: 0,1,0,1,1,0 vs 0,1,1,0,1,0. Different.\n\nColumn 2 and Column 6: 0,1,0,1,1,0 vs 1,1,0,1,0,0. Different.\n\nColumn 3 and Column 4: 1,0,1,0,0,1 vs 1,0,0,1,0,1. Different.\n\nColumn 3 and Column 5: 1,0,1,0,0,1 vs 0,1,1,0,1,0. Different.\n\nColumn 3 and Column 6: 1,0,1,0,0,1 vs 1,1,0,1,0,0. Different.\n\nColumn 4 and Column 5: 1,0,0,1,0,1 vs 0,1,1,0,1,0. Different.\n\nColumn 4 and Column 6: 1,0,0,1,0,1 vs 1,1,0,1,0,0. Different.\n\nColumn 5 and Column 6: 0,1,1,0,1,0 vs 1,1,0,1,0,0. Different.\n\nSo, all columns are unique.\n\nWait, but I just noticed something else. Let me check the rows again for consecutive duplicates.\n\nIn Option A, Row 6: 1,0,1,1,0,0.\n\nLet me check for three consecutive same numbers. 1,0,1,1,0,0. So, 1,0,1, then two 1s? No, wait: 1,0,1,1,0,0. So, 1,0,1, then 1,1, which is two 1s. Then 0,0, which is two 0s. So, that's allowed. So, no three in a row.\n\nSimilarly, check columns for three in a row.\n\nColumn 1: 0,0,1,0,1,1. So, two 0s, then 1, then 0, then 1,1. So, no three in a row.\n\nColumn 2: 0,1,0,1,1,0. 0,1,0,1,1,0. So, two 1s at the end. Allowed.\n\nColumn 3: 1,0,1,0,0,1. No three in a row.\n\nColumn 4: 1,0,0,1,0,1. Two 0s in the middle, allowed.\n\nColumn 5: 0,1,1,0,1,0. Two 1s, allowed.\n\nColumn 6: 1,1,0,1,0,0. Two 1s, allowed.\n\nSo, all columns are fine.\n\nTherefore, Option A seems to satisfy all the rules.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check if Option A is the correct one, or if I missed something.\n\nWait, in the initial problem statement, it says \"the correct grid configuration from the options below.\" So, given that, and that only Option A satisfies all the rules, I think Option A is the correct answer.\n\nBut let me just check once more for any possible mistakes.\n\nLooking at Option A:\n\nRow 1: 0 0 1 1 0 1 → okay.\n\nRow 2: 0 1 0 0 1 1 → okay.\n\nRow 3: 1 0 1 0 1 0 → okay.\n\nRow 4: 0 1 0 1 0 1 → okay.\n\nRow 5: 1 1 0 0 1 0 → okay.\n\nRow 6: 1 0 1 1 0 0 → okay.\n\nAll rows have three 0s and three 1s, no three in a row, and all unique.\n\nColumns:\n\nColumn 1: 0 0 1 0 1 1 → three 0s, three 1s, no three in a row, unique.\n\nSimilarly, all other columns meet the criteria.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that Option A is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nAfter carefully analyzing each option based on the Binairo rules, Option A is the only one that satisfies all the conditions: no more than two consecutive identical numbers, equal number of 0s and 1s in each row and column, and all rows and columns being unique.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n\\boxed{A}", "ground_truth": "A", "prompt": "You need to solve a Binairo puzzle (Size: 6x6).You need to solve a Binairo puzzle.\n\n**Binairo Puzzle Rules:**\n1.

{"question_id": "binairo_706", "response": "Alright, let's try to solve this Binairo puzzle. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll do my best by carefully checking each option against the rules.\n\nFirst, I remember the rules:\n\n1. Each cell is either 0 or 1.\n2. No more than two consecutive identical numbers in any row or column. So, no three in a row.\n3. Each row and column must have an equal number of 0s and 1s. Since it's a 4x4 grid, that means exactly two 0s and two 1s in each row and column.\n4. No two rows or columns can be identical.\n\nOkay, so I need to check each option against these rules.\n\nLet's start with Option A:\n\nOption A:\n1 0 0 1\n0 1 0 1\n1 0 1 0\n0 1 1 0\n\nLet me check each row first.\n\nRow 1: 1,0,0,1\n- Check for consecutive duplicates: 0,0 is two in a row, which is allowed. The rest are single, so no problem.\n- Count of 0s and 1s: Two 0s and two 1s. Good.\nRow 2: 0,1,0,1\n- No consecutive duplicates. Good.\n- Counts: Two 0s, two 1s.

Good.\nColumn 3: 0,0,1,1\n- First two are 0s. That's two, which is okay.\n- Last two are 1s. Two again, okay.\n- Counts: Two 0s, two 1s. Good.\nColumn 4: 1,1,0,0\n- First two 1s, then two 0s. Both are allowed.\n- Counts: Two 0s, two 1s. Good.\n\nNow, check if any rows are identical. Let's see:\n\nRow 1: 1 0 0 1\nRow 2: 0 1 0 1\nRow 3: 1 0 1 0\nRow 4: 0 1 1 0\n\nAll rows are different.

{"question_id": "binairo_79", "response": "Okay, so I have this Binairo puzzle to solve, and I need to choose between four options: A, B, C, or D. Each option is a 6x6 grid filled with 0s and 1s. Let me go through the rules again to make sure I understand what I'm looking for.\n\nFirst, each cell must be either 0 or 1. That's straightforward. The second rule says no more than two consecutive identical numbers in any row or column. So, I can't have three 0s or three 1s in a row or column. The third rule requires each row and column to have an equal number of 0s and 1s. Since it's a 6x6 grid, each row and column must have exactly three 0s and three 1s. The fourth rule states that no two rows or columns can be identical. So, every row must be unique, and every column must also be unique.\n\nAlright, now I need to check each option against these rules. Let's start with Option A.\n\n**Option A:**\nRow 1: 0 1 1 0 0 1\nLet me check for consecutive numbers. There's a 1,1 and then 0,0 later. So, two 1s and two 0s in a row, which is allowed. Now, does the row have three 0s and three 1s? Let's count: 0,1,1,0,0,1. That's three 0s and three 1s. Good. Next, is this row unique? I'll have to check all rows, but let's move on.\n\nRow 2: 1 1 0 0 1 0\nConsecutive: 1,1 and 0,0. Allowed. Count: three 1s and three 0s. Good.\n\nRow 3: 0 0 1 1 0 1\nConsecutive: 0,0 and 1,1. Allowed. Count: three 0s, three 1s.\n\nRow 4: 1 0 0 1 0 1\nConsecutive: 0,0 and 0,1. Wait, let's see: 1,0,0,1,0,1. So, 0,0 is two, and the rest are alternating. So, no three in a row. Count: 1,0,0,1,0,1. That's three 1s and three 0s.\n\nRow 5: 0 1 1 0 1 0\nConsecutive: 1,1 and 0,0. Allowed. Count: three 0s and three 1s.\n\nRow 6: 1 0 0 1 1 0\nConsecutive: 0,0 and 1,1. Allowed. Count: three 1s and three 0s.\n\nNow, checking for uniqueness of rows. Let me list them:\n\n1: 0 1 1 0 0 1\n2: 1 1 0 0 1 0\n3: 0 0 1 1 0 1\n4: 1 0 0 1 0 1\n5: 0 1 1 0 1 0\n6: 1 0 0 1 1 0\n\nAre any of these rows identical? Let me compare:\n\nRow 1 and Row 5: Both start with 0,1,1,0... but Row 1 is 0,1,1,0,0,1 and Row 5 is 0,1,1,0,1,0. So different.\n\nRow 2 and Row 6: Row 2 is 1,1,0,0,1,0; Row 6 is 1,0,0,1,1,0. Not the same.\n\nRows 3, 4, 5, 6 are all unique. So all rows are unique. Now, checking columns.\n\nEach column must also have exactly three 0s and three 1s and no three in a row. Let's look at the columns.\n\nColumn 1:\nRow1:0\nRow2:1\nRow3:0\nRow4:1\nRow5:0\nRow6:1\nSo column 1: 0,1,0,1,0,1. No consecutive duplicates beyond two. Also, counts: three 0s and three 1s. Good.\n\nColumn 2:\nRow1:1\nRow2:1\nRow3:0\nRow4:0\nRow5:1\nRow6:0\nSo column 2: 1,1,0,0,1,0. Consecutive 1s and 0s, but only two each. Counts: three 1s and three 0s. Good.\n\nColumn 3:\nRow1:1\nRow2:0\nRow3:1\nRow4:0\nRow5:1\nRow6:0\nSo column 3: 1,0,1,0,1,0. Alternating, no consecutive duplicates. Counts: three 1s and three 0s. Good.\n\nColumn 4:\nRow1:0\nRow2:0\nRow3:1\nRow4:1\nRow5:0\nRow6:1\nSo column 4: 0,0,1,1,0,1. Consecutive 0s and 1s, but only two each. Counts: three 0s and three 1s. Good.\n\nColumn 5:\nRow1:0\nRow2:1\nRow3:0\nRow4:0\nRow5:1\nRow6:1\nSo column 5: 0,1,0,0,1,1. Wait, here we have two 0s in a row (rows 3 and 4) and two 1s at the end (rows 5 and 6). So that's okay. But let me check for three in a row: 0,0 is two, and 1,1 is two. So no three, so it's fine. Counts: three 0s and three 1s.\n\nColumn 6:\nRow1:1\nRow2:0\nRow3:1\nRow4:1\nRow5:0\nRow6:0\nSo column 6: 1,0,1,1,0,0. Here, rows 4 and 5: 1,1 is two, and rows 5 and 6: 0,0 is two. So no three in a row. Counts: three 1s and three 0s. Good.\n\nNow, check if all columns are unique. Let's list each column as a string:\n\nColumn1: 0,1,0,1,0,1 → \"010101\"\nColumn2: 1,1,0,0,1,0 → \"110010\"\nColumn3: 1,0,1,0,1,0 → \"101010\"\nColumn4: 0,0,1,1,0,1 → \"001101\"\nColumn5: 0,1,0,0,1,1 → \"010011\"\nColumn6: 1,0,1,1,0,0 → \"101100\"\n\nAre any of these the same? Let's see:\n\n- \"010101\" is unique.\n- \"110010\" is unique.\n- \"101010\" is unique.\n- \"001101\" is unique.\n- \"010011\" is unique.\n- \"101100\" is unique.\n\nSo all columns are unique. So Option A satisfies all the rules.\n\nBut before I conclude, let me check the other options to make sure none of them also satisfy, but perhaps only one is correct.\n\n**Option B:**\nRow 1:1 1 1 0 0 1\nWait, this row starts with three 1s. That's a problem because rule 2 says no more than two consecutive identical numbers. So three 1s in a row is invalid. Therefore, Option B is invalid.\n\n**Option C:**\nLet me check Option C.\n\nRow 1:0 1 1 0 0 1\nSame as Option A. So far, okay.\n\nRow 2:1 1 0 0 1 0\nSame as Option A. So rows 1 and 2 are same as A, which is fine as long as all rows are unique. Let's check further.\n\nRow 3:0 0 1 1 0 1\nSame as Option A, row3.\n\nRow 4:1 0 0 0 0 1\nWait, let's look at this row: 1,0,0,0,0,1. There are four 0s in a row (positions 2,3,4,5). That's four consecutive 0s, which violates rule 2. So this row is invalid. Therefore, Option C is invalid.\n\n**Option D:**\nCheck Option D.\n\nRow1:0 1 1 0 0 1\nSame as A.\n\nRow2:1 1 0 0 1 0\nSame as A.\n\nRow3:0 0 1 1 0 1\nSame as A.\n\nRow4:1 0 0 1 0 1\nSame as A.\n\nRow5:0 1 1 0 1 0\nSame as A.\n\nRow6:1 0 0 1 1 1\nHmm, row6: 1,0,0,1,1,1. Let's check for consecutive duplicates. 0,0 is two, then 1,1,1 is three. That's a problem because three 1s in a row are not allowed. So row6 in Option D is invalid. Therefore, Option D is invalid.\n\nSo, only Option A seems to satisfy all the rules. But just to be thorough, I should check if all rows and columns in A are unique, which I did earlier, and they are. So Option A is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe correct answer is Option A as it satisfies all the Binairo puzzle rules without any violations.\n\n\\boxed{A}", "ground_truth": "A", "prompt": "You need to solve a Binairo puzzle (Size: 6x6).You need to solve a Binairo puzzle.\n\n**Binairo Puzzle Rules:**\n1.

{"question_id": "binairo_623", "response": "Okay, so I have to solve this Binairo puzzle. It's a 6x6 grid, and each cell must be either 0 or 1. The rules are a bit specific, so I need to go through each one carefully. Let me list them again to make sure I understand:\n\n1. Each cell is 0 or 1. That's straightforward.\n2. No more than two consecutive identical numbers in any row or column. So, I can't have three 0s or three 1s in a row or column in a straight line.\n3. Each row and column must have an equal number of 0s and 1s. Since it's a 6x6 grid, each row and column must have exactly three 0s and three 1s.\n4. No two rows can be identical, and no two columns can be identical.\n\nThe options given are A, B, C, D, each with their own 6x6 grid. I need to check each option against these rules to find the correct one.\n\nLet me start by examining each option one by one.\n\n**Option A:**\nRow 1: 0 0 1 0 1 1\nRow 2: 0 1 1 0 1 0\nRow 3: 1 1 0 1 0 0\nRow 4: 1 0 1 0 0 1\nRow 5: 0 1 0 1 1 0\nRow 6: 1 0 0 1 0 1\n\nFirst, I'll check each row for consecutive numbers.\n\nRow 1: 0 0 1 0 1 1\n- The first two are 0s. That's okay, only two in a row. Then 1, 0, 1, 1. The last two are 1s, which is two in a row. So that's acceptable.\n- Now, check the number of 0s and 1s. Row 1 has four 0s and two 1s? Wait, let me count: 0,0,1,0,1,1 → that's four 0s and two 1s. But the rule says each row must have three 0s and three 1s. So Option A's first row already violates rule 3. Therefore, Option A is invalid. I can eliminate A.\n\nWait, maybe I miscounted. Let me recount:\n\nRow 1: 0,0,1,0,1,1. So 0s are positions 1,2,4 → three 0s. 1s are positions 3,5,6 → three 1s. Oh, I see, I was wrong earlier. So three each. So it's okay.\n\nWait, I thought it was four 0s but it's actually three. So row 1 is okay.\n\nWait, but the first two 0s are consecutive, that's allowed, only two in a row. Then the last two 1s are also consecutive, allowed. So no problem with rule 2. Okay, so row 1 is okay.\n\nLet me check row 2: 0 1 1 0 1 0\n- Consecutive numbers: 1,1. That's two in a row, allowed.\n- Number of 0s: positions 1,4,6 → three 0s. 1s: positions 2,3,5 → three 1s. So okay.\n\nRow 3: 1 1 0 1 0 0\n- Consecutive 1s at the start: two, allowed. Then 0,1,0,0. The last two 0s are consecutive, which is allowed. So rule 2 is okay.\n- Count: 1s at 1,2,4 → three. 0s at 3,5,6 → three. So okay.\n\nRow 4: 1 0 1 0 0 1\n- 1,0,1,0,0,1. Consecutive: 0,1,0, then 0,0, which is two in a row. Allowed.\n- Count: 1s at 1,3,6 → three. 0s at 2,4,5 → three. So okay.\n\nRow 5: 0 1 0 1 1 0\n- Consecutive 1s at positions 4 and 5. That's two, allowed. The rest are alternating.\n- Count: 0s at 1,3,6 → three. 1s at 2,4,5 → three. Okay.\n\nRow 6: 1 0 0 1 0 1\n- Consecutive 0s at positions 2 and 3. Two in a row, allowed. Then 1,0,1. No three in a row anywhere.\n- Count: 1s at 1,4,6 → three. 0s at 2,3,5 → three. Okay.\n\nSo all rows in Option A satisfy rules 2 and 3. Now, let's check the columns.\n\nColumn 1: 0,0,1,1,0,1\n- Looking for consecutive identical numbers. 0,0 is two in a row, allowed. Then 1,1 is two, allowed. Then 0,1. No three in a row anywhere.\n- Count: 0s: positions 1,2,5 → three. 1s: positions 3,4,6 → three. Okay.\n\nColumn 2: 0,1,1,0,1,0\n- 1,1 is two in a row, allowed. Then 0,1,0. No three in a row.\n- Count: 0s at 1,4,6 → three. 1s at 2,3,5 → three. Okay.\n\nColumn 3: 1,1,0,1,0,0\n- 1,1 is two, allowed. Then 0,1,0,0. The last two 0s are two in a row, allowed.\n- Count: 1s at 1,2,4 → three. 0s at 3,5,6 → three. Okay.\n\nColumn 4: 0,0,1,0,1,1\n- 0,0 is two, allowed. Then 1,0,1,1. 1,1 is two, allowed.\n- Count: 0s at 1,2,4 → three. 1s at 3,5,6 → three. Okay.\n\nColumn 5: 1,1,0,0,1,0\n- 1,1 is two, allowed. Then 0,0 is two, allowed. Then 1,0. No three in a row.\n- Count: 1s at 1,2,5 → three. 0s at 3,4,6 → three. Okay.\n\nColumn 6: 1,0,0,1,0,1\n- 0,0 is two, allowed. Then 1,0,1. No three in a row.\n- Count: 1s at 1,4,6 → three. 0s at 2,3,5 → three. Okay.\n\nSo all columns in Option A satisfy rules 2 and 3.\n\nNow, check rule 4: No two rows can be identical, and no two columns can be identical.\n\nLooking at the rows:\n\nRow 1: 0 0 1 0 1 1\n\nRow 2: 0 1 1 0 1 0\n\nRow 3: 1 1 0 1 0 0\n\nRow 4: 1 0 1 0 0 1\n\nRow 5: 0 1 0 1 1 0\n\nRow 6: 1 0 0 1 0 1\n\nI can see that all rows are different. Let me confirm:\n\nRow 1 vs Row 2: Different.\n\nRow 1 vs Row 3: Different.\n\nRow 1 vs Row 4: Different.\n\nRow 1 vs Row 5: Different.\n\nRow 1 vs Row 6: Different.\n\nSimilarly, all other rows are different from each other. So no two rows are identical.\n\nNow, columns:\n\nLooking at the columns, are any two columns identical?\n\nColumn 1: 0,0,1,1,0,1\n\nColumn 2: 0,1,1,0,1,0\n\nColumn 3: 1,1,0,1,0,0\n\nColumn 4: 0,0,1,0,1,1\n\nColumn 5: 1,1,0,0,1,0\n\nColumn 6: 1,0,0,1,0,1\n\nLet me compare each pair:\n\nColumn 1 vs Column 2: Different.\n\nColumn 1 vs Column 3: Different.\n\nColumn 1 vs Column 4: Different.\n\nColumn 1 vs Column 5: Different.\n\nColumn 1 vs Column 6: Different.\n\nColumn 2 vs Column 3: Different.\n\nColumn 2 vs Column 4: Different.\n\nColumn 2 vs Column 5: Different.\n\nColumn 2 vs Column 6: Different.\n\nColumn 3 vs Column 4: Different.\n\nColumn 3 vs Column 5: Different.\n\nColumn 3 vs Column 6: Different.\n\nColumn 4 vs Column 5: Different.\n\nColumn 4 vs Column 6: Different.\n\nColumn 5 vs Column 6: Different.\n\nSo all columns are unique. Therefore, Option A satisfies rule 4.\n\nWait, but I thought Option A had a problem earlier, but it seems all rules are satisfied. Hmm.\n\nWait, let me double-check the counts for each row and column because sometimes I might have miscounted.\n\nLooking at Row 1: 0,0,1,0,1,1 → three 0s and three 1s. Correct.\n\nRow 2: 0,1,1,0,1,0 → three 0s and three 1s. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, all rows have three each.\n\nColumns as well. So maybe Option A is correct. But let me check the other options as well, just to be sure.\n\n**Option B:**\n\nRow 1: 1 0 1 0 1 1\n\nRow 2: 0 1 1 0 1 0\n\nRow 3: 1 1 0 1 0 0\n\nRow 4: 1 0 1 0 0 1\n\nRow 5: 0 1 0 1 1 0\n\nRow 6: 1 0 0 1 0 1\n\nFirst, check each row.\n\nRow 1: 1 0 1 0 1 1\n\n- Consecutive: 1,0,1,0,1,1. The last two 1s are allowed. So rule 2 is okay.\n- Count: 1s at positions 1,3,5,6 → four 1s. 0s at 2,4 → two 0s. Wait, that's four 1s and two 0s. That violates rule 3, which requires three 0s and three 1s. So Option B is invalid. Therefore, B is out.\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\nRow 1: 1,0,1,0,1,1 → 1s: positions 1,3,5,6 (four times). 0s: 2,4 (twice). So yes, four 1s and two 0s. So it's invalid. So Option B is eliminated.\n\n**Option C:**\n\nRow 1: 0 0 1 0 1 1\n\nRow 2: 0 1 1 0 1 0\n\nRow 3: 1 1 0 1 0 0\n\nRow 4: 1 0 1 1 0 1\n\nRow 5: 0 1 0 1 1 0\n\nRow 6: 1 0 0 1 0 1\n\nLet me check each row for consecutive numbers and counts.\n\nRow 1: 0,0,1,0,1,1. Consecutive 0s and 1s are okay. Count: 3 0s, 3 1s.\n\nRow 2: 0,1,1,0,1,0. Consecutive 1s at positions 2-3. Count: 3 0s, 3 1s.\n\nRow 3: 1,1,0,1,0,0. Consecutive 1s and 0s. Count: 3 0s, 3 1s.\n\nRow 4: 1,0,1,1,0,1. Consecutive 1s at positions 3-4. Count: 1s: 1,3,4,6 → four 1s. 0s: 2,5 → two 0s. So this row has four 1s and two 0s. That violates rule 3. Therefore, Option C is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, let me recount Row 4:\n\n1,0,1,1,0,1. So 1s are positions 1,3,4,6 → four 1s. 0s at 2,5 → two. So yes, violates rule 3. So Option C is out.\n\n**Option D:**\n\nRow 1: 0 0 1 0 1 1\n\nRow 2: 0 1 1 0 1 0\n\nRow 3: 1 1 0 1 0 0\n\nRow 4: 1 0 1 0 0 1\n\nRow 5: 0 1 0 1 1 0\n\nRow 6: 1 0 0 1 0 0\n\nLet me check each row.\n\nRow 1: 0,0,1,0,1,1 → okay. Count: 3 0s, 3 1s.\n\nRow 2: 0,1,1,0,1,0 → okay. Count: 3 0s, 3 1s.\n\nRow 3: 1,1,0,1,0,0 → okay. Count: 3 0s, 3 1s.\n\nRow 4: 1,0,1,0,0,1 → okay. Count: 3 0s, 3 1s.\n\nRow 5: 0,1,0,1,1,0 → okay. Count: 3 0s, 3 1s.\n\nRow 6: 1,0,0,1,0,0 → Let's check consecutive numbers. 0,0 at the end. Two in a row, allowed. Then 1,0,0,1,0,0. Wait, positions 2-3: 0,0. Positions 5-6: 0,0. So two sets of two 0s. Count: 1s at 1,4 → two 1s. 0s at 2,3,5,6 → four 0s. So this row has two 1s and four 0s. That violates rule 3, which requires three each. So Option D is invalid.\n\nWait, let me recount Row 6: 1,0,0,1,0,0.\n\n1s: positions 1,4 → two. 0s: positions 2,3,5,6 → four. So yes, two 1s and four 0s. So Option D is out.\n\nSo, after checking all options, only Option A satisfies all the rules. But wait, earlier I thought Option A was correct, but when I looked at the columns, I need to make sure that no two columns are identical.\n\nWait, in Option A, let me check the columns again, just to be thorough.\n\nColumn 1: 0,0,1,1,0,1\n\nColumn 2: 0,1,1,0,1,0\n\nColumn 3: 1,1,0,1,0,0\n\nColumn 4: 0,0,1,0,1,1\n\nColumn 5: 1,1,0,0,1,0\n\nColumn 6: 1,0,0,1,0,1\n\nAre any of these columns identical? Let's compare each pair.\n\nColumn 1 vs Column 2: [0,0,1,1,0,1] vs [0,1,1,0,1,0]. Different.\n\nColumn 1 vs Column 3: [0,0,1,1,0,1] vs [1,1,0,1,0,0]. Different.\n\nColumn 1 vs Column 4: [0,0,1,1,0,1] vs [0,0,1,0,1,1]. Wait, these look similar but let me compare each position:\n\nPosition 1: 0 vs 0\n\nPosition 2: 0 vs 0\n\nPosition 3:1 vs1\n\nPosition4:1 vs0\n\nPosition5:0 vs1\n\nPosition6:1 vs1\n\nSo at position4, Column1 has 1, Column4 has 0. So they differ. So not identical.\n\nColumn1 vs Column5: [0,0,1,1,0,1] vs [1,1,0,0,1,0]. Different.\n\nColumn1 vs Column6: [0,0,1,1,0,1] vs [1,0,0,1,0,1]. Different.\n\nNow, Column2 vs Column3: [0,1,1,0,1,0] vs [1,1,0,1,0,0]. Different.\n\nColumn2 vs Column4: [0,1,1,0,1,0] vs [0,0,1,0,1,1]. Different.\n\nColumn2 vs Column5: [0,1,1,0,1,0] vs [1,1,0,0,1,0]. Let's see:\n\nPosition1:0 vs1 → different.\n\nSo they're different.\n\nColumn2 vs Column6: [0,1,1,0,1,0] vs [1,0,0,1,0,1]. Different.\n\nColumn3 vs Column4: [1,1,0,1,0,0] vs [0,0,1,0,1,1]. Different.\n\nColumn3 vs Column5: [1,1,0,1,0,0] vs [1,1,0,0,1,0]. Let's compare:\n\nPosition1:1 vs1\n\nPosition2:1 vs1\n\nPosition3:0 vs0\n\nPosition4:1 vs0 → different.\n\nSo different.\n\nColumn3 vs Column6: [1,1,0,1,0,0] vs [1,0,0,1,0,1]. Different.\n\nColumn4 vs Column5: [0,0,1,0,1,1] vs [1,1,0,0,1,0]. Different.\n\nColumn4 vs Column6: [0,0,1,0,1,1] vs [1,0,0,1,0,1]. Different.\n\nColumn5 vs Column6: [1,1,0,0,1,0] vs [1,0,0,1,0,1]. Different.\n\nSo all columns are unique. Therefore, Option A satisfies all rules.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought Option A was correct, but when I checked the rows, everything was fine, and columns as well. So Option A seems to be the correct answer.\n\nWait, but the user provided Option A, B, C, D, and I have to choose one. But according to my analysis, only Option A is valid. But wait, let me check again because sometimes I might have missed something.\n\nWait, in Option A, let me check if any row or column has three consecutive same numbers.\n\nRow 1: 0 0 1 0 1 1 → no three in a row.\n\nRow 2: 0 1 1 0 1 0 → no three in a row.\n\nRow 3: 1 1 0 1 0 0 → no three in a row.\n\nRow 4: 1 0 1 0 0 1 → no three in a row.\n\nRow 5: 0 1 0 1 1 0 → no three in a row.\n\nRow 6: 1 0 0 1 0 1 → no three in a row.\n\nColumns:\n\nColumn1: 0,0,1,1,0,1 → no three in a row.\n\nColumn2: 0,1,1,0,1,0 → no three in a row.\n\nColumn3:1,1,0,1,0,0 → no three in a row.\n\nColumn4:0,0,1,0,1,1 → no three in a row.\n\nColumn5:1,1,0,0,1,0 → no three in a row.\n\nColumn6:1,0,0,1,0,1 → no three in a row.\n\nSo all rows and columns satisfy rule 2.\n\nAlso, each row and column has exactly three 0s and 1s, so rule 3 is satisfied.\n\nNo two rows are identical, and no two columns are identical, so rule 4 is satisfied.\n\nTherefore, Option A is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe correct answer is Option A because it satisfies all the given Binairo rules: no more than two consecutive identical numbers, equal number of 0s and 1s in each row and column, and all rows and columns are unique.\n\n\\boxed{A}", "ground_truth": "A", "prompt": "You need to solve a Binairo puzzle (Size: 6x6).You need to solve a Binairo puzzle.\n\n**Binairo Puzzle Rules:**\n1.

{"question_id": "binairo_595", "response": "Okay, so I need to solve this Binairo puzzle, and there are four options to choose from. Let me start by recalling the rules to make sure I don't miss anything.\n\nFirst, each cell must be either 0 or 1. That's straightforward. Second, no more than two consecutive identical numbers in any row or column. So, I can't have three 0s or three 1s in a row or column. Third, each row and column must have an equal number of 0s and 1s. Since it's a 4x4 grid, that means each row and column must have exactly two 0s and two 1s. Fourth, no two rows can be identical, and no two columns can be identical either.\n\nAlright, so let's look at the options one by one and check them against these rules.\n\nStarting with Option A:\n\n1 0 0 1  \n0 0 1 1  \n0 1 1 0  \n1 1 0 0  \n\nLet me check each row first for consecutive numbers.\n\nRow 1: 1 0 0 1  \n- There are two 0s in a row, but that's allowed because it's only two. Then it goes back to 1. So, no problem here.\n\nRow 2: 0 0 1 1  \n- Again, two 0s and two 1s. So, that's okay.\n\nRow 3: 0 1 1 0  \n- Two 1s in the middle, which is allowed.\n\nRow 4: 1 1 0 0  \n- Two 1s followed by two 0s. That's acceptable.\n\nNow, checking each column for consecutive numbers.\n\nColumn 1: 1, 0, 0, 1  \n- The first two are 1 and 0, then 0 and 0. Wait, that's two 0s, which is okay. Then 0 and 1. So, no three in a row.\n\nColumn 2: 0, 0, 1, 1  \n- Two 0s, then two 1s. That's acceptable.\n\nColumn 3: 0, 1, 1, 0  \n- Two 1s, then 0s. Fine.\n\nColumn 4: 1, 1, 0, 0  \n- Two 1s, then two 0s. Good.\n\nNext, checking if each row and column has exactly two 0s and two 1s.\n\nRow 1: 1,0,0,1 → counts as two 0s and two 1s.  \nRow 2: 0,0,1,1 → same.  \nRow 3: 0,1,1,0 → same.  \nRow 4: 1,1,0,0 → same.\n\nAll rows are good. Now columns:\n\nColumn 1: 1,0,0,1 → two 0s and two 1s.  \nColumn 2: 0,0,1,1 → same.  \nColumn 3: 0,1,1,0 → same.  \nColumn 4: 1,1,0,0 → same.\n\nAll columns are good.\n\nNow, check for identical rows and columns.\n\nLooking at the rows:\n\nRow 1: 1 0 0 1  \nRow 2: 0 0 1 1  \nRow 3: 0 1 1 0  \nRow 4: 1 1 0 0  \n\nAre any of these identical?

Now columns:\n\nColumn 1: 1,0,0,1  \nColumn 2: 0,0,1,1  \nColumn 3: 0,1,1,0  \nColumn 4: 1,1,0,0  \n\nAre any columns identical?\n\nColumn 1 vs Column 3: 1,0,0,1 vs 0,1,1,0 → Not the same.\n\nColumn 1 vs Column 4: 1,0,0,1 vs 1,1,0,0 → Not the same.\n\nColumn 2 vs Column 3: 0,0,1,1 vs 0,1,1,0 → Not the same.\n\nColumn 2 vs Column 4: 0,0,1,1 vs 1,1,0,0 → Not the same.\n\nColumn 3 vs Column 4: 0,1,1,0 vs 1,1,0,0 → Not the same.\n\nSo, all columns are unique as well. So, Option A satisfies all the rules.\n\nWait, but let me check the options again.

Oh, wait, that has three 0s in a row. That's a violation of rule 2. So, Option B is invalid. So, I can eliminate B immediately.\n\nOption C:\n\n1 0 0 1  \n0 0 1 1  \n0 1 0 0  \n1 1 0 0  \n\nLet's check each row first.\n\nRow 1: 1 0 0 1 → two 0s, okay.\n\nRow 2: 0 0 1 1 → two 0s, two 1s, okay.\n\nRow 3: 0 1 0 0 → two 0s at the end. Wait, that's two 0s, which is okay, but let's check the counts.\n\nRow 3: 0,1,0,0 → three 0s? Wait, no, 0,1,0,0: that's three 0s? Wait, no, let's count: positions 1:0, 2:1, 3:0, 4:0. So, three 0s. That's a problem. Because each row must have exactly two 0s and two 1s. So, Row 3 in Option C has three 0s and one 1. That violates rule 3. So, Option C is invalid.\n\nOption D:\n\n1 0 0 1  \n0 0 1 1  \n0 1 1 0  \n1 1 0 1  \n\nLet me check the rows first.\n\nRow 1: 1 0 0 1 → two 0s, okay.\n\nRow 2: 0 0 1 1 → two 0s, two 1s, okay.\n\nRow 3: 0 1 1 0 → two 1s, okay.\n\nRow 4: 1 1 0 1 → Wait, that's three 1s. 1,1,0,1. So, three 1s in a row. That's a violation of rule 2. So, Option D is invalid.\n\nSo, from the four options, only Option A satisfies all the rules. Let me double-check Option A again for any mistakes I might have missed.\n\nLooking at each row:\n\n1 0 0 1 → counts: two 0s, two 1s.  \n0 0 1 1 → same.  \n0 1 1 0 → same.  \n1 1 0 0 → same.\n\nColumns:\n\nColumn 1: 1,0,0,1 → two 0s, two 1s.  \nColumn 2: 0,0,1,1 → same.  \nColumn 3: 0,1,1,0 → same.  \nColumn 4: 1,1,0,0 → same.\n\nNo three in a row anywhere. Rows and columns are all unique.\n\nWait, but let me check for columns again. For example, Column 1: 1,0,0,1. So, 1,0,0,1. Are there any three consecutive same numbers? No, because after two 0s, it goes back to 1. Similarly, Column 2: 0,0,1,1 → two 0s, two 1s, no three in a row. So, that's fine.\n\nAlso, all rows and columns are unique, so no duplicates.\n\nTherefore, Option A is the correct solution.\n</think>\n\nThe correct answer is Option A because it adheres to all the Binairo rules without any violations.\n\n\\boxed{A}", "ground_truth": "A", "prompt": "You need to solve a Binairo puzzle (Size: 4x4).You need to solve a Binairo puzzle.\n\n**Binairo Puzzle Rules:**\n1.

{"question_id": "binairo_1415", "response": "Alright, so I've got this Binairo puzzle to solve. It's a 4x4 grid, and I need to figure out which of the four options (A, B, C, D) is the correct solution. Let me go through each option step by step, checking against the rules to see which one fits.\n\nFirst, let me recap the rules to make sure I don't miss anything:\n\n1. **Each cell must be 0 or 1.** – All options seem to comply since they only have 0s and 1s.\n\n2. **No more than two consecutive identical numbers in any row or column.** – So, no three 0s or 1s in a row. I'll need to check each row and column for this.\n\n3. **Each row and column must have an equal number of 0s and 1s.** – Since it's a 4x4 grid, each row and column should have exactly two 0s and two 1s.\n\n4. **No two rows can be identical, and no two columns can be identical.** – So, all four rows must be unique, and all four columns must be unique.\n\nAlright, let's go through each option one by one.\n\n**Option A:**\n```\n0 1 1 0\n1 1 0 0\n1 0 0 1\n0 0 1 1\n```\n\nLet me check the rows first.\n\n- **Row 1:** 0,1,1,0. There's a pair of 1s but no three in a row. Good. Number of 0s: 2, 1s: 2. Okay.\n- **Row 2:** 1,1,0,0. Similarly, two 1s followed by two 0s. No three in a row. Counts are 2 each. Good.\n- **Row 3:** 1,0,0,1. Two 0s in the middle. No three in a row. Counts are 2 each.\n- **Row 4:** 0,0,1,1. Two 0s followed by two 1s. Counts are 2 each. Good.\n\nNow, checking for identical rows. All rows are different. Row 1 is 0,1,1,0. Row 2 is 1,1,0,0. Row 3 is 1,0,0,1. Row 4 is 0,0,1,1. So, no duplicates. Good.\n\nNow, columns:\n\n- **Column 1:** 0,1,1,0. Let's see: 0,1,1,0. No three in a row. Counts: two 0s and two 1s. Good.\n- **Column 2:** 1,1,0,0. Again, two 1s followed by two 0s. No three in a row. Counts are 2 each.\n- **Column 3:** 1,0,0,1. Two 0s. No three in a row. Counts: two each.\n- **Column 4:** 0,0,1,1. Two 0s followed by two 1s. Counts are 2 each.\n\nNow, checking if any columns are identical. Column 1 is 0,1,1,0. Column 2 is 1,1,0,0. Column 3 is 1,0,0,1. Column 4 is 0,0,1,1. All columns are unique. So, Option A seems to satisfy all the rules.\n\nBut wait, I should check the other options too, just to be thorough.\n\n**Option B:**\n```\n1 1 1 0\n1 1 0 0\n1 0 0 1\n0 0 1 1\n```\n\nLet's check the rows.\n\n- **Row 1:** 1,1,1,0. Oh, there are three 1s in a row. That's a violation of rule 2. So, Option B is invalid.\n\nSo, I can eliminate Option B right away.\n\n**Option C:**\n```\n0 1 1 0\n1 1 0 0\n1 0 1 1\n0 0 1 1\n```\n\nChecking rows first.\n\n- **Row 1:** 0,1,1,0. Good, no three in a row. Counts: 2 each.\n- **Row 2:** 1,1,0,0. Good, counts okay.\n- **Row 3:** 1,0,1,1. Let's see: 1,0,1,1. Here, the last two are 1s. But before that, there's a 0, so only two 1s. Wait, no, the last two are 1s, but is that allowed? Yes, because it's only two. So, no three in a row. Counts: two 1s, two 0s. Wait, Row 3 has 1,0,1,1: that's three 1s. Wait, no, the first is 1, then 0, then 1,1. So, two 1s at the end. So, only two consecutive. So, okay. But let's count the total: 1,0,1,1 has three 1s. Oh! Wait, that's a problem. Each row must have exactly two 0s and two 1s. So, Row 3 has three 1s and one 0. That's a violation of rule 3. So, Option C is invalid.\n\nWait, let me count again. 1,0,1,1: 1 occurs three times, 0 once. So yes, that's three 1s. So, rule 3 is broken. So, Option C is out.\n\n**Option D:**\n```\n0 1 1 0\n1 1 0 0\n1 0 0 1\n0 0 1 0\n```\n\nLet's check rows first.\n\n- **Row 1:** 0,1,1,0. Good, two 1s, two 0s. No three in a row.\n- **Row 2:** 1,1,0,0. Same as above. Good.\n- **Row 3:** 1,0,0,1. Good, two 0s, two 1s. No three in a row.\n- **Row 4:** 0,0,1,0. Let's see: 0,0,1,0. So, two 0s at the start, then 1, then 0. No three in a row. Counts: three 0s and one 1. Wait, that's three 0s. That's a violation of rule 3. Each row must have exactly two 0s and two 1s. So, Row 4 in Option D has three 0s and one 1. So, that's invalid.\n\nWait, let me count again. 0,0,1,0: that's three 0s and one 1. Yes, so Rule 3 is broken here. So, Option D is invalid.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\n- Option A: All rules satisfied.\n- Option B: Violates Rule 2 in Row 1.\n- Option C: Violates Rule 3 in Row 3.\n- Option D: Violates Rule 3 in Row 4.\n\nTherefore, the only valid option is A.\n</think>\n\nThe correct answer is Option A, as it satisfies all the Binairo rules without any violations.\n\n\\boxed{A}", "ground_truth": "A", "prompt": "You need to solve a Binairo puzzle (Size: 4x4).You need to solve a Binairo puzzle.\n\n**Binairo Puzzle Rules:**\n1.

{"question_id": "binairo_794", "response": "Okay, so I need to solve this Binairo puzzle and choose the correct option from A to D. Let me try to understand the rules again and then check each option step by step.\n\nFirst, the rules of Binairo:\n\n1. Each cell is either 0 or 1.\n2. No more than two consecutive identical numbers in any row or column. So, no three in a row.\n3. Each row and column must have an equal number of 0s and 1s. Since it's a 6x6 grid, each row and column must have exactly 3 zeros and 3 ones.\n4. No two rows can be identical, and no two columns can be identical.\n\nAlright, so I need to check each option against these rules.\n\nLet me start by looking at each option one by one.\n\nOption A:\n```\n1 1 0 1 0 0\n0 1 1 0 1 0\n1 0 1 0 0 1\n1 0 0 1 0 1\n0 1 0 1 1 0\n0 0 1 0 1 1\n```\n\nLet me check the first rule: each cell is 0 or 1. Yes, all are 0 or 1.\n\nSecond rule: no more than two consecutive same numbers. Let's check each row.\n\nRow 1: 1 1 0 1 0 0. Wait, there are two 1s at the start, which is okay. Then 0, 1, 0, 0. The last two are 0s, so that's two, which is okay. So row 1 is fine.\n\nRow 2: 0 1 1 0 1 0. Two 1s in the middle, okay. No three in a row. Fine.\n\nRow 3: 1 0 1 0 0 1. Let's see: 1,0,1,0,0,1. Only two 0s at the end, which is okay. So row 3 is fine.\n\nRow 4: 1 0 0 1 0 1. There are two 0s in the middle, which is okay. Fine.\n\nRow 5: 0 1 0 1 1 0. Two 1s at the end. Okay.\n\nRow 6: 0 0 1 0 1 1. Two 0s at the start, okay. Then two 1s at the end, okay.\n\nSo for rows, no three in a row. Now, check columns.\n\nColumn 1: 1,0,1,1,0,0. Let's see: 1,0,1,1. So 1,0,1,1: the last three are 1,1,0. Wait, no, the first four are 1,0,1,1. So the first, third, and fourth are 1. That's two in a row in 1,0,1,1. So that's okay because only two 1s. Similarly, in column 1, are there any three in a row? Let's see: the sequence is 1,0,1,1,0,0.\n\nLooking at consecutive cells:\n\nPositions 1: 1,0 (no)\nPositions 2: 0,1 (no)\nPositions 3: 1,1 (two, okay)\nPositions 4: 1,0 (no)\nPositions 5: 0,0 (two, okay)\nSo column 1 is fine.\n\nColumn 2: 1,1,0,0,1,0.\n\nLooking for three in a row. 1,1: two, okay. Then 0,0: two, okay. Then 1,0: no. So column 2 is fine.\n\nColumn 3: 0,1,1,0,0,1.\n\nLooking for three in a row. 0,1,1: only two 1s, okay. Then 1,0: no. 0,0: two, okay. 0,1: no. So column 3 is fine.\n\nColumn 4: 1,0,0,1,1,0.\n\nLooking for three in a row. 1,0: no. 0,0: two, okay. Then 0,1: no. 1,1: two, okay. Then 1,0: no. So column 4 is fine.\n\nColumn 5: 0,1,0,0,1,1.\n\nLooking for three in a row. 0,1: no. 1,0: no. 0,0: two, okay. 0,1: no. 1,1: two, okay. So column 5 is fine.\n\nColumn 6: 0,0,1,1,0,1.\n\nLooking for three in a row. 0,0: two, okay. 0,1: no. 1,1: two, okay. 1,0: no. 0,1: no. So column 6 is fine.\n\nSo rule 2 is satisfied for Option A.\n\nNow rule 3: each row and column must have exactly 3 zeros and 3 ones.\n\nLet's check rows:\n\nRow 1: 1,1,0,1,0,0. Count of 1s: 1,1,1, so 3. Zeros: 3. Okay.\n\nRow 2: 0,1,1,0,1,0. 1s: three. Zeros: three. Okay.\n\nRow 3: 1,0,1,0,0,1. 1s: 1,1,1 (three). Zeros: three. Okay.\n\nRow 4: 1,0,0,1,0,1. 1s: 1,1,1 (three). Zeros: three. Okay.\n\nRow 5: 0,1,0,1,1,0. 1s: three. Zeros: three. Okay.\n\nRow 6: 0,0,1,0,1,1. 1s: three. Zeros: three. Okay.\n\nSo rows are fine.\n\nNow columns:\n\nColumn 1: 1,0,1,1,0,0. 1s: 1,1,1,1 (four). Wait, that's four 1s, which is not allowed. Because each column must have exactly three 1s and three 0s. So column 1 has four 1s. That violates rule 3.\n\nWait, so Option A is invalid because column 1 has four 1s and two 0s. So Option A is out.\n\nMoving on to Option B:\n\nOption B:\n```\n0 1 0 1 0 0\n0 1 1 0 1 0\n1 0 1 0 0 1\n1 0 0 1 0 1\n0 1 0 1 1 0\n0 0 1 0 1 1\n```\n\nCheck each row for consecutive numbers.\n\nRow 1: 0 1 0 1 0 0. Let's see: 0,1,0,1,0,0. Consecutive same numbers: only two 0s at the end. So okay.\n\nRow 2: 0 1 1 0 1 0. Two 1s in the middle. Okay.\n\nRow 3: 1 0 1 0 0 1. Two 0s at the end. Okay.\n\nRow 4: 1 0 0 1 0 1. Two 0s in the middle. Okay.\n\nRow 5: 0 1 0 1 1 0. Two 1s at the end. Okay.\n\nRow 6: 0 0 1 0 1 1. Two 0s at the start, two 1s at the end. Okay.\n\nSo rows are fine.\n\nNow columns:\n\nColumn 1: 0,0,1,1,0,0.\n\nCheck for consecutive: 0,0: two, okay. Then 1,1: two, okay. Then 0,0: two, okay. So no three in a row.\n\nCount of 1s and 0s in column 1: 0,0,1,1,0,0. 1s: 2, 0s: 4. Wait, that's 2 ones and 4 zeros. That violates rule 3, which requires 3 ones and 3 zeros. So Option B is invalid.\n\nSo Option B is out.\n\nOption C:\n\n```\n1 1 0 1 0 0\n0 1 1 0 1 0\n1 0 1 0 0 1\n1 0 0 0 0 1\n0 1 0 1 1 0\n0 0 1 0 1 1\n```\n\nFirst, check the rows.\n\nRow 1: 1 1 0 1 0 0. Consecutive 1s: two, okay. Then 0,1,0,0. Two 0s at the end, okay.\n\nRow 2: 0 1 1 0 1 0. Two 1s, okay.\n\nRow 3: 1 0 1 0 0 1. Two 0s at the end, okay.\n\nRow 4: 1 0 0 0 0 1. Wait, here we have four 0s in a row. 0,0,0,0. That's four in a row, which violates rule 2. So row 4 is invalid. Therefore, Option C is out.\n\nOption D:\n\n```\n1 1 0 1 0 0\n0 1 1 0 1 0\n1 0 1 0 0 1\n1 0 0 1 0 1\n0 1 0 1 1 0\n0 0 1 0 1 0\n```\n\nCheck rows first.\n\nRow 1: 1 1 0 1 0 0. Two 1s, two 0s at the end. Okay.\n\nRow 2: 0 1 1 0 1 0. Two 1s, okay.\n\nRow 3: 1 0 1 0 0 1. Two 0s at the end, okay.\n\nRow 4: 1 0 0 1 0 1. Two 0s, okay.\n\nRow 5: 0 1 0 1 1 0. Two 1s, okay.\n\nRow 6: 0 0 1 0 1 0. Two 0s at the start, okay. Then 0,1: no. 1,0: no. So no three in a row. Okay.\n\nSo rows are fine.\n\nNow columns.\n\nCheck each column for consecutive same numbers and counts.\n\nColumn 1:\n\n1,0,1,1,0,0.\n\nLooking for three in a row. 1,0,1,1: only two 1s. Then 1,0: no. Then 0,0: two, okay.\n\nCounts: 1s: positions 1,3,4: three. 0s: positions 2,5,6: three. So okay.\n\nColumn 2:\n\n1,1,0,0,1,0.\n\nLooking for three in a row. 1,1: two, okay. Then 0,0: two, okay. Then 1,0: no. So okay.\n\nCounts: 1s: positions 1,2,5: three. 0s: positions 3,4,6: three. Okay.\n\nColumn 3:\n\n0,1,1,0,0,1.\n\nLooking for three in a row. 0,1,1: two 1s, okay. Then 1,0: no. 0,0: two, okay. Then 0,1: no. So okay.\n\nCounts: 1s: positions 2,3,6: three. 0s: positions 1,4,5: three. Okay.\n\nColumn 4:\n\n1,0,0,1,1,0.\n\nLooking for three in a row. 1,0: no. 0,0: two, okay. Then 0,1: no. 1,1: two, okay. Then 1,0: no. So okay.\n\nCounts: 1s: positions 1,4,5: three. 0s: positions 2,3,6: three. Okay.\n\nColumn 5:\n\n0,1,0,0,1,1.\n\nLooking for three in a row. 0,1: no. 1,0: no. 0,0: two, okay. 0,1: no. 1,1: two, okay. So okay.\n\nCounts: 1s: positions 2,5,6: three. 0s: positions 1,3,4: three. Okay.\n\nColumn 6:\n\n0,0,1,1,0,0.\n\nLooking for three in a row. 0,0: two, okay. 1,1: two, okay. 0,0: two, okay. So okay.\n\nCounts: 1s: positions 3,4: two. Wait, that's only two 1s. 0s: positions 1,2,5,6: four. Wait, that's four 0s. Wait, column 6: 0,0,1,1,0,0. So 1s: two, 0s: four. That's 2 ones and 4 zeros. That violates rule 3. Each column must have 3 ones and 3 zeros.\n\nWait, did I count correctly? Let me recount column 6:\n\nRow 1: 0\n\nRow 2: 0\n\nRow 3:1\n\nRow 4:1\n\nRow 5:0\n\nRow 6:0\n\nSo 0,0,1,1,0,0. So 1s are at positions 3 and 4: two. 0s: four. So yes, that's two 1s and four 0s. That's invalid. So column 6 in Option D is invalid.\n\nWait, but that's a problem. So Option D is invalid because column 6 doesn't have equal 1s and 0s.\n\nWait, but I thought earlier columns were okay, but column 6 fails.\n\nHmm. So now I'm confused because all options except A had issues, but A had column 1 with four 1s. D had column 6 with two 1s and four 0s.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in counting. Let me check column 6 again for Option D.\n\nOption D's column 6:\n\nRow 1: 0\n\nRow 2: 0\n\nRow 3:1\n\nRow 4:1\n\nRow 5:0\n\nRow 6:0\n\nSo total 1s: 2, 0s: 4. Yes, that's not equal. So column 6 is invalid.\n\nWait, but that's a problem because all options seem to have issues. Let me check if I made a mistake in evaluating the options.\n\nWait, Option A: column 1 had four 1s, so invalid.\n\nOption B: column 1 had two 1s, four 0s, invalid.\n\nOption C: row 4 had four 0s, invalid.\n\nOption D: column 6 had two 1s, four 0s, invalid.\n\nHmm, that's strange. The user said that there must exist a right answer, so I must have made a mistake in evaluating.\n\nWait, let me double-check Option D's column 6.\n\nOption D's column 6:\n\nRow 1:0\n\nRow 2:0\n\nRow 3:1\n\nRow 4:1\n\nRow 5:0\n\nRow 6:0\n\nSo 0 appears four times, 1 appears two times. So that's four 0s, two 1s. So column 6 is invalid.\n\nWait, but maybe I misread the option.\n\nLet me look back at Option D:\n\n```\n1 1 0 1 0 0\n0 1 1 0 1 0\n1 0 1 0 0 1\n1 0 0 1 0 1\n0 1 0 1 1 0\n0 0 1 0 1 0\n```\n\nSo the sixth column is:\n\nRow 1:0\n\nRow 2:0\n\nRow 3:1\n\nRow 4:1\n\nRow 5:0\n\nRow 6:0\n\nYes, that's correct. So four 0s, two 1s. So column 6 in D is invalid.\n\nHmm, this is confusing because the user says there's a correct answer among A-D.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating another option. Let me check Option B again.\n\nOption B:\n\n```\n0 1 0 1 0 0\n0 1 1 0 1 0\n1 0 1 0 0 1\n1 0 0 1 0 1\n0 1 0 1 1 0\n0 0 1 0 1 1\n```\n\nCheck column 6:\n\nRow 1:0\n\nRow 2:0\n\nRow 3:1\n\nRow 4:1\n\nRow 5:0\n\nRow 6:1\n\nSo column 6: 0,0,1,1,0,1.\n\nCount of 1s: positions 3,4,6: three. 0s: positions 1,2,5: three. So column 6 is okay.\n\nWait, earlier I thought Option B's column 1 was invalid, but let me check column 1 again.\n\nColumn 1 of Option B:\n\nRow 1:0\n\nRow 2:0\n\nRow 3:1\n\nRow 4:1\n\nRow 5:0\n\nRow 6:0\n\nSo column 1: 0,0,1,1,0,0.\n\nCount of 1s: 2 (rows 3 and 4). 0s: 4 (rows 1,2,5,6). So column 1 has two 1s and four 0s, which violates rule 3.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought Option B's column 1 was invalid. So Option B is invalid.\n\nWait, but earlier when I checked Option D, I thought column 6 was invalid, but perhaps I made a mistake there.\n\nWait, Option D's column 6: 0,0,1,1,0,0. So 1s: two, 0s: four. So invalid.\n\nWait, but perhaps I misread the options. Let me check Option D again.\n\nOption D:\n\n```\n1 1 0 1 0 0\n0 1 1 0 1 0\n1 0 1 0 0 1\n1 0 0 1 0 1\n0 1 0 1 1 0\n0 0 1 0 1 0\n```\n\nSo row 6 of Option D is 0 0 1 0 1 0.\n\nSo column 6: 0 (row1), 0 (row2), 1 (row3), 1 (row4), 0 (row5), 0 (row6).\n\nSo 0 appears four times, 1 appears two times. So column 6 has four 0s, two 1s. That's invalid.\n\nHmm, so all options except maybe I misread.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake with Option C.\n\nOption C:\n\n```\n1 1 0 1 0 0\n0 1 1 0 1 0\n1 0 1 0 0 1\n1 0 0 0 0 1\n0 1 0 1 1 0\n0 0 1 0 1 1\n```\n\nRow 4: 1 0 0 0 0 1. So four 0s in a row, which violates rule 2. So Option C is invalid.\n\nSo the only options left are A, B, C, D. But all have issues except maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread Option D's column 6. Let me check again.\n\nOption D's column 6:\n\nRow 1:0\n\nRow 2:0\n\nRow 3:1\n\nRow 4:1\n\nRow 5:0\n\nRow 6:0\n\nSo 0 appears four times, 1 appears two times. So column 6 is invalid.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake in counting the 1s and 0s.\n\nWait, in column 6 of Option D:\n\nRow 1:0\n\nRow 2:0\n\nRow 3:1\n\nRow 4:1\n\nRow 5:0\n\nRow 6:0\n\nSo that's 0,0,1,1,0,0.\n\nSo 1s are at rows 3 and 4: two.\n\n0s are at rows 1,2,5,6: four.\n\nSo yes, column 6 in D has four 0s and two 1s. So invalid.\n\nHmm. So perhaps none of the options are correct, but the user says there is a right answer. So I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check the options again, maybe I misread some numbers.\n\nLet me check Option A again.\n\nOption A:\n\n```\n1 1 0 1 0 0\n0 1 1 0 1 0\n1 0 1 0 0 1\n1 0 0 1 0 1\n0 1 0 1 1 0\n0 0 1 0 1 1\n```\n\nColumn 1: 1,0,1,1,0,0.\n\nSo 1s: 1,0,1,1,0,0.\n\nSo 1s: positions 1,3,4: three.\n\n0s: positions 2,5,6: three.\n\nSo column 1 is okay.\n\nWait, earlier I thought column 1 had four 1s, but now I count three. Let me recount.\n\nRow 1:1\n\nRow 2:0\n\nRow3:1\n\nRow4:1\n\nRow5:0\n\nRow6:0\n\nSo 1s: rows 1,3,4: three.\n\n0s: rows 2,5,6: three.\n\nSo column 1 in A is okay.\n\nWait, earlier I thought column 1 had four 1s, but that was a mistake. So Option A's column 1 is okay.\n\nWait, so I must have made a mistake earlier. Let me recheck Option A.\n\nOption A's column 1: 1,0,1,1,0,0.\n\nSo 1 appears three times, 0 appears three times. So column 1 is okay.\n\nSo Option A passes rule 3 for columns.\n\nNow, check column 6 in Option A.\n\nColumn 6: 0,0,1,1,0,1.\n\nSo 0s: rows 1,2,5: three.\n\n1s: rows 3,4,6: three.\n\nSo column 6 is okay.\n\nSo Option A's columns are okay.\n\nWait, earlier I thought Option A's column 1 was invalid, but it's actually okay.\n\nSo let me reevaluate Option A.\n\nOption A:\n\nRows: all have three 1s and 0s.\n\nColumns: all have three 1s and 0s.\n\nNow, check rule 2: no three consecutive same numbers.\n\nIn Option A, rows:\n\nRow 1:1 1 0 1 0 0. So 1,1 is two, okay. 0,0 is two, okay.\n\nRow 2:0 1 1 0 1 0. Two 1s, okay.\n\nRow 3:1 0 1 0 0 1. Two 0s, okay.\n\nRow 4:1 0 0 1 0 1. Two 0s, okay.\n\nRow 5:0 1 0 1 1 0. Two 1s, okay.\n\nRow 6:0 0 1 0 1 1. Two 0s, two 1s, okay.\n\nColumns:\n\nColumn 1:1 0 1 1 0 0. 1,0,1,1: only two 1s. Then 0,0: two, okay.\n\nColumn 2:1 1 0 0 1 0. Two 1s, two 0s, okay.\n\nColumn3:0 1 1 0 0 1. Two 1s, two 0s, okay.\n\nColumn4:1 0 0 1 1 0. Two 0s, two 1s, okay.\n\nColumn5:0 1 0 0 1 1. Two 0s, two 1s, okay.\n\nColumn6:0 0 1 1 0 1. Two 0s, two 1s, okay.\n\nSo Option A passes rule 2.\n\nNow, rule 4: no two rows identical, no two columns identical.\n\nCheck rows:\n\nRow 1:1 1 0 1 0 0\n\nRow 2:0 1 1 0 1 0\n\nRow 3:1 0 1 0 0 1\n\nRow 4:1 0 0 1 0 1\n\nRow 5:0 1 0 1 1 0\n\nRow 6:0 0 1 0 1 1\n\nAre any rows identical?

{"question_id": "binairo_782", "response": "Alright, let's try to figure out which option is the correct solution for this Binairo puzzle. I'm not too familiar with Binairo puzzles, but I know the rules, so I'll go through each option step by step and check if they meet all the criteria.\n\nFirst, let me recap the rules to make sure I don't miss anything:\n\n1. Each cell must be 0 or 1.\n2. No more than two consecutive identical numbers in any row or column. So, no three in a row.\n3. Each row and column must have an equal number of 0s and 1s. Since it's a 4x4 grid, each row and column must have exactly two 0s and two 1s.\n4. No two rows can be identical, and no two columns can be identical either.\n\nOkay, so I'll go through each option one by one and check these rules.\n\n**Option A:**\n```\n0 0 1 1\n0 1 1 0\n1 0 0 1\n1 1 0 0\n```\n\nLet me check each row first.\n\nRow 1: 0,0,1,1\n- Consecutive duplicates: The first two are 0s, that's two in a row. Then two 1s. So, that's okay because it's exactly two. So rule 2 is satisfied.\n- Equal number of 0s and 1s: Two 0s and two 1s. Good.\n\nRow 2: 0,1,1,0\n- Consecutive duplicates: The middle two 1s. Again, two in a row. Fine.\n- 0s and 1s: Two each. Good.\n\nRow 3: 1,0,0,1\n- Consecutive 0s: Two in a row. Fine.\n- Counts: Two 0s, two 1s. Good.\n\nRow 4: 1,1,0,0\n- Consecutive 1s and then 0s. Two each. Counts are equal. Good.\n\nNow, check columns.\n\nColumn 1: 0,0,1,1\n- Consecutive 0s: Two at the start. Then two 1s. So, okay.\n- Counts: Two 0s, two 1s. Good.\n\nColumn 2: 0,1,0,1\n- Alternating, no more than two same in a row. Good.\n- Counts: Two 0s, two 1s. Good.\n\nColumn 3: 1,1,0,0\n- Consecutive 1s and 0s. Two each. Counts are fine.\n\nColumn 4: 1,0,1,0\n- Alternating. No issues. Counts: two each.\n\nNow, check for identical rows or columns.\n\nRows:\nRow 1: 0011\nRow 2: 0110\nRow 3: 1001\nRow 4: 1100\nAll different.

Fine.\n- Counts: two 1s and two 0s? Wait, let's count: 1,0,1,1. That's three 1s and one 0. Oh, that's a problem. Rule 3: Each row must have two 0s and two 1s. So, this row has three 1s and one 0. So, it's invalid.\n\nSo, Option B is out.\n\n**Option C:**\n```\n0 0 1 1\n0 1 1 0\n1 0 1 1\n1 1 0 0\n```\n\nCheck rows:\n\nRow 1: 0,0,1,1 – okay, two each. Good.\n\nRow 2: 0,1,1,0 – okay, two each.\n\nRow 3: 1,0,1,1 – three 1s, one 0. Again, violates rule 3. So, invalid.\n\nSo, Option C is out.\n\n**Option D:**\n```\n0 0 1 1\n0 1 1 0\n1 0 0 1\n1 1 0 1\n```\n\nCheck rows:\n\nRow 1: 0,0,1,1 – okay.\n\nRow 2: 0,1,1,0 – okay.\n\nRow 3: 1,0,0,1 – okay.\n\nRow 4: 1,1,0,1 – Let's count: three 1s and one 0. So, three 1s. That's a violation of rule 3. So, invalid.\n\nSo, Option D is out.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me double-check Option D's rows. Maybe I miscounted.\n\nRow 4: 1,1,0,1. So, positions 1,2,4 are 1s. That's three 1s. So yes, it's three. So, invalid.\n\nSo, only Option A is valid.\n\nBut wait, let me check Option A again for columns. Let me see if any column has more than two same numbers in a row.\n\nColumn 1: 0,0,1,1 – two 0s followed by two 1s. That's okay.\n\nColumn 2: 0,1,0,1 – alternating, no problem.\n\nColumn 3: 1,1,0,0 – two 1s, two 0s. Fine.\n\nColumn 4: 1,0,1,0 – alternating, good.\n\nSo, all columns are fine.\n\nAlso, rows: none have three in a row, and all have two 0s and two 1s.\n\nAnd all rows and columns are unique.

{"question_id": "binairo_1494", "response": "Okay, so I have to solve a 4x4 Binairo puzzle and choose the correct option from A, B, C, or D. Let me first make sure I understand the rules properly.\n\nRule 1: Each cell is either 0 or 1. That's straightforward.\n\nRule 2: No more than two consecutive identical numbers in any row or column. So, patterns like 000 or 111 are forbidden. So in any row or column, I can't have three of the same number in a row. That means after two 0s, I need a 1, and vice versa.\n\nRule 3: Each row and column must have an equal number of 0s and 1s. Since the grid is 4x4, each row and column must have exactly two 0s and two 1s. So no row or column can have three of one and one of the other.\n\nRule 4: No two rows can be identical, and no two columns can be identical.

This has alternating 1s and 0s. So no more than two consecutive same numbers, so Rule 2 is satisfied. It has two 1s and two 0s, so Rule 3 is okay. Also, this row isn't repeated in the other rows, so uniqueness is maintained.\n\nRow 2: 0,0,1,1. Here, the first two are 0s, which is okay because it's only two. Then two 1s. So that's fine. It also has two 0s and two 1s. And it's different from Row 1.\n\nRow 3: 0,1,0,1. Again, alternating. So no consecutive duplicates, two of each. Unique row.\n\nRow 4: 1,1,0,0. Two 1s followed by two 0s. So that's acceptable. Also, two of each and unique.\n\nNow, checking columns.\n\nColumn 1: 1,0,0,1. Let's see: 1,0 is fine. Then 0,0 is two consecutive 0s, which is allowed. Then 0,1 is fine. So overall, no three in a row. Also, two 1s and two 0s. And since columns are 1,0,0,1 and the other columns are different, uniqueness holds.\n\nColumn 2: 0,0,1,1. Similar to Row 2. Two 0s, then two 1s. So that's fine. Two of each, unique.\n\nColumn 3: 1,1,0,0. Same as Row 4. Two 1s, then two 0s. Good, two of each. Also unique.\n\nColumn 4: 0,1,1,0. So 0,1 is fine, 1,1 is two, then 1,0 is fine.

Then 0,0 is two, then 0,1. So overall, two 0s and two 1s. No three in a row. Unique.\n\nColumn 2: 0,0,1,1. Wait, that's two 0s followed by two 1s. That's fine, but let's check if any column is repeated. Looking at Column 4.\n\nColumn 3: 1,1,0,0. Similar to Column 2.\n\nColumn 4: 0,1,1,1. Wait, here we have three 1s in a row at the end.

{"question_id": "binairo_1070", "response": "Okay, I need to solve this Binairo puzzle and choose the correct option from A, B, C, or D. Let me start by recalling the rules of Binairo because it's been a while since I've done one. \n\nSo, the rules are:\n\n1. Each cell must be 0 or 1.\n2. No more than two consecutive identical numbers in any row or column. So, no three in a row.\n3. Each row and column must have an equal number of 0s and 1s. Since it's a 6x6 grid, each row and column must have exactly 3 zeros and 3 ones.\n4. No two rows can be identical, and no two columns can be identical.\n\nAlright, let me look at the options one by one and check them against these rules.\n\nStarting with Option A:\n\nOption A's grid is:\n1 0 0 1 0 1\n1 1 0 0 1 0\n0 0 1 1 0 1\n0 0 1 0 1 1\n1 1 0 1 0 0\n0 1 1 0 1 0\n\nLet me check each row first for the consecutive numbers rule.\n\nRow 1: 1 0 0 1 0 1\n- Check for three in a row: 1 0 0 is fine, then 0 1 is okay, 1 0, 0 1. No three same numbers in a row. Good.\n\nRow 2: 1 1 0 0 1 0\n- 1 1 is two, then 0 0 is two. Then 1 0. No three in a row. Good.\n\nRow 3: 0 0 1 1 0 1\n- 0 0 and 1 1, then 0 1. No three in a row. Good.\n\nRow 4: 0 0 1 0 1 1\n- 0 0, then 1 0 1, then 1 1. The last two are 1s. So that's two, which is okay. So no three in a row. Good.\n\nRow 5: 1 1 0 1 0 0\n- 1 1, then 0 1, then 0 0. So again, two in a row, which is fine.\n\nRow 6: 0 1 1 0 1 0\n- 0 1, then 1 1, then 0 1, then 0. The middle two 1s are two, so that's okay.\n\nNow, check each row for exactly 3 zeros and 3 ones.\n\nRow 1: 1,0,0,1,0,1 → 3 ones and 3 zeros. Good.\n\nRow 2: 1,1,0,0,1,0 → 3 ones and 3 zeros. Good.\n\nRow 3: 0,0,1,1,0,1 → 3 ones and 3 zeros. Good.\n\nRow 4: 0,0,1,0,1,1 → 3 ones and 3 zeros. Good.\n\nRow 5: 1,1,0,1,0,0 → 3 ones and 3 zeros. Good.\n\nRow 6: 0,1,1,0,1,0 → 3 ones and 3 zeros. Good.\n\nNext, check that no two rows are identical. Let me compare each row:\n\nRow 1: 1 0 0 1 0 1\nRow 2: 1 1 0 0 1 0\nRow 3: 0 0 1 1 0 1\nRow 4: 0 0 1 0 1 1\nRow 5: 1 1 0 1 0 0\nRow 6: 0 1 1 0 1 0\n\nLooking at these, they all look different. For example, Row 1 starts with 1, Row 2 starts with 1 but has two 1s at the beginning, so different. Row 3 starts with 0, so different. So, no duplicates in rows.\n\nNow check the columns for the same rules.\n\nEach column must have exactly 3 zeros and 3 ones, and no three in a row.\n\nLet me go column by column.\n\nColumn 1:\nRow1:1\nRow2:1\nRow3:0\nRow4:0\nRow5:1\nRow6:0\nSo, Column 1: 1,1,0,0,1,0 → counts: 3 ones, 3 zeros. Good.\n\nCheck for three in a row: 1,1 is two, then 0,0 is two. Then 1,0. No three in a row. Good.\n\nColumn 2:\nRow1:0\nRow2:1\nRow3:0\nRow4:0\nRow5:1\nRow6:1\nColumn2: 0,1,0,0,1,1 → 3 ones, 3 zeros.\n\nCheck for three in a row: 0,1,0 is okay. Then 0,0 is two, then 1,1 is two. So no three in a row. Good.\n\nColumn3:\nRow1:0\nRow2:0\nRow3:1\nRow4:1\nRow5:0\nRow6:1\nColumn3: 0,0,1,1,0,1 → 3 ones, 3 zeros.\n\nCheck for three in a row: 0,0 is two, 1,1 is two. Then 0,1. No three in a row. Good.\n\nColumn4:\nRow1:1\nRow2:0\nRow3:1\nRow4:0\nRow5:1\nRow6:0\nColumn4: 1,0,1,0,1,0 → Alternating. No two in a row, so definitely no three. Also, 3 ones and 3 zeros. Good.\n\nColumn5:\nRow1:0\nRow2:1\nRow3:0\nRow4:1\nRow5:0\nRow6:1\nColumn5: 0,1,0,1,0,1 → Alternating. No two in a row, so no three. 3 ones and 3 zeros. Good.\n\nColumn6:\nRow1:1\nRow2:0\nRow3:1\nRow4:1\nRow5:0\nRow6:0\nColumn6: 1,0,1,1,0,0 → 3 ones and 3 zeros.\n\nCheck for three in a row: 1,0,1 is okay. Then 1,1 is two. Then 0,0 is two. No three in a row. Good.\n\nSo, Option A seems to satisfy all the rules so far. But wait, I need to check if any two columns are identical. Let me check columns:\n\nColumn1: 1,1,0,0,1,0\nColumn2: 0,1,0,0,1,1\nColumn3: 0,0,1,1,0,1\nColumn4: 1,0,1,0,1,0\nColumn5: 0,1,0,1,0,1\nColumn6: 1,0,1,1,0,0\n\nLooking at these, all columns seem different. For example, Column1 starts with two 1s, others don't. Column2 starts with 0,1,0,0... which is unique. Similarly, others have different patterns. So, no duplicate columns.\n\nHmm, so Option A seems valid. Let me check the other options just in case.\n\nOption B:\n\n0 0 0 1 0 1\n1 1 0 0 1 0\n0 0 1 1 0 1\n0 0 1 0 1 1\n1 1 0 1 0 0\n0 1 1 0 1 0\n\nFirst, checking each row for consecutive numbers:\n\nRow1: 0 0 0 1 0 1 → Oh, wait! The first three are 0s. That's three in a row. So this violates rule 2. Therefore, Option B is invalid. So I can eliminate B.\n\nMoving on to Option C:\n\n1 0 0 1 0 1\n1 1 0 0 1 0\n0 0 1 1 0 1\n0 0 1 1 1 1 → Wait, this row has four 1s at the end. Let me check row 4: 0 0 1 1 1 1. That's four 1s in a row at the end. So that's four, which violates the two consecutive rule. So Option C is invalid.\n\nOption D:\n\n1 0 0 1 0 1\n1 1 0 0 1 0\n0 0 1 1 0 1\n0 0 1 0 1 1\n1 1 0 1 0 0\n0 1 1 0 1 1\n\nLet me check each row for consecutive numbers:\n\nRow1: 1 0 0 1 0 1 → No three in a row. Good.\n\nRow2: 1 1 0 0 1 0 → Two 1s, two 0s. Good.\n\nRow3: 0 0 1 1 0 1 → Two 0s, two 1s. Good.\n\nRow4: 0 0 1 0 1 1 → Two 0s, then 1, then two 1s. So two 1s at the end. Good.\n\nRow5: 1 1 0 1 0 0 → Two 1s, then 0, 1, two 0s. Good.\n\nRow6: 0 1 1 0 1 1 → Two 1s in the middle and two 1s at the end. Wait, let me see: 0,1,1,0,1,1. So between the 5th and 6th positions, there are two 1s. So that's okay, two in a row. So no three in a row.\n\nNow, check each row for 3 zeros and 3 ones.\n\nRow1: 3 ones, 3 zeros. Good.\n\nRow2: 3 ones, 3 zeros. Good.\n\nRow3: 3 ones, 3 zeros. Good.\n\nRow4: 0,0,1,0,1,1 → 3 ones, 3 zeros. Good.\n\nRow5: 1,1,0,1,0,0 → 3 ones, 3 zeros. Good.\n\nRow6: 0,1,1,0,1,1 → 3 ones, 3 zeros. Good.\n\nNow, check if any two rows are identical. Looking at the rows:\n\nRow1: 1 0 0 1 0 1\nRow2: 1 1 0 0 1 0\nRow3: 0 0 1 1 0 1\nRow4: 0 0 1 0 1 1\nRow5: 1 1 0 1 0 0\nRow6: 0 1 1 0 1 1\n\nThey all look different. For example, Row1 starts with 1,0,0, while Row2 starts with 1,1, so different. Row3 starts with 0,0. So no duplicates.\n\nNow, check the columns. Each column must have 3 ones and 3 zeros, and no three in a row.\n\nLet's go column by column.\n\nColumn1:\nRow1:1\nRow2:1\nRow3:0\nRow4:0\nRow5:1\nRow6:0\nSo Column1: 1,1,0,0,1,0 → 3 ones, 3 zeros.\n\nCheck for three in a row: 1,1 is two; 0,0 is two; then 1,0. No three in a row. Good.\n\nColumn2:\nRow1:0\nRow2:1\nRow3:0\nRow4:0\nRow5:1\nRow6:1\nSo Column2: 0,1,0,0,1,1 → 3 ones, 3 zeros.\n\nCheck for three in a row: 0,1,0 is okay; 0,0 is two; 1,1 is two. No three in a row. Good.\n\nColumn3:\nRow1:0\nRow2:0\nRow3:1\nRow4:1\nRow5:0\nRow6:1\nSo Column3: 0,0,1,1,0,1 → 3 ones, 3 zeros.\n\nCheck for three in a row: 0,0 is two; 1,1 is two; then 0,1. Good.\n\nColumn4:\nRow1:1\nRow2:0\nRow3:1\nRow4:0\nRow5:1\nRow6:0\nSo Column4: 1,0,1,0,1,0 → Alternating. No two in a row. 3 ones, 3 zeros. Good.\n\nColumn5:\nRow1:0\nRow2:1\nRow3:0\nRow4:1\nRow5:0\nRow6:1\nSo Column5: 0,1,0,1,0,1 → Alternating. 3 ones, 3 zeros. Good.\n\nColumn6:\nRow1:1\nRow2:0\nRow3:1\nRow4:1\nRow5:0\nRow6:1\nSo Column6: 1,0,1,1,0,1 → 3 ones, 3 zeros.\n\nCheck for three in a row: 1,0,1 is okay; 1,1 is two; 0,1 is okay. No three in a row. Good.\n\nNow, check if any two columns are identical.\n\nColumn1: 1,1,0,0,1,0\nColumn2: 0,1,0,0,1,1\nColumn3: 0,0,1,1,0,1\nColumn4: 1,0,1,0,1,0\nColumn5: 0,1,0,1,0,1\nColumn6: 1,0,1,1,0,1\n\nLooking at these, they all seem different. For example, Column1 has two 1s at the start, while Column2 starts with 0. Column3 starts with two 0s, Column4 starts with 1,0,1..., Column5 starts with 0,1,0..., Column6 starts with 1,0,1,1... So, no duplicates. So, Option D seems valid.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought Option A was valid. So now I have both A and D as possible. But wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, no, I think I made a mistake. Let me check Option A again.\n\nLooking back at Option A, I thought it was valid. But wait, I just realized that in Option D, Row6 is 0 1 1 0 1 1, which ends with two 1s. But that's allowed because it's only two. So that's fine.\n\nBut I need to check if both A and D are valid or if one of them has an error. Let me double-check.\n\nLooking back at Option A:\n\nRow1: 1 0 0 1 0 1 → Good.\n\nRow2: 1 1 0 0 1 0 → Good.\n\nRow3: 0 0 1 1 0 1 → Good.\n\nRow4: 0 0 1 0 1 1 → Ends with two 1s. Good.\n\nRow5: 1 1 0 1 0 0 → Good.\n\nRow6: 0 1 1 0 1 0 → Good.\n\nColumns all checked out.\n\nNow, Option D:\n\nRow1: same as A.\n\nRow2: same as A.\n\nRow3: same as A.\n\nRow4: same as A except the last two are 1s instead of 1,1. Wait, no, looking back, in Option A, Row4 is 0 0 1 0 1 1, which is the same as Option D's Row4. Hmm, wait, no, looking at the grids:\n\nOption A's Row4: 0 0 1 0 1 1\n\nOption D's Row4: same.\n\nWait, no, in Option D, Row4 is 0 0 1 0 1 1. So same as A.\n\nBut looking at Option D's Row6: 0 1 1 0 1 1.\n\nWait, but in Option A, Row6 is 0 1 1 0 1 0. So different.\n\nSo, in Option D, Row6 ends with two 1s, while in A it ends with a 0.\n\nSo, both A and D seem to satisfy the rules.\n\nBut the problem says that each column must have exactly 3 ones and 3 zeros, and no two columns can be identical. So, perhaps one of the options has duplicate columns.\n\nWait, let me check Option A's columns again.\n\nOption A's columns:\n\nColumn1: 1,1,0,0,1,0 → unique.\n\nColumn2: 0,1,0,0,1,1 → unique.\n\nColumn3: 0,0,1,1,0,1 → unique.\n\nColumn4: 1,0,1,0,1,0 → unique.\n\nColumn5: 0,1,0,1,0,1 → unique.\n\nColumn6: 1,0,1,1,0,0 → unique.\n\nSo, all columns unique.\n\nOption D's columns:\n\nSame as A except for Row6.\n\nSo, Column6 in D:\n\nRow6:1 → 1\n\nSo, Column6: Row1:1, Row2:0, Row3:1, Row4:1, Row5:0, Row6:1.\n\nSo, Column6 in D: 1,0,1,1,0,1.\n\nCompare to Column6 in A: 1,0,1,1,0,0.\n\nSo, they are different. So, in D, all columns are unique.\n\nWait, but in Option D, are all rows unique? Let's check.\n\nRows in D:\n\nRow1: same as A.\n\nRow2: same as A.\n\nRow3: same as A.\n\nRow4: same as A.\n\nRow5: same as A.\n\nRow6: different.\n\nSo, in D, Row6 is different, so no duplicate rows.\n\nWait, but in A, all rows are unique, so that's fine.\n\nHmm, but the problem says that the correct answer is among the options, so perhaps both A and D are correct? But that can't be, since the problem states to choose one.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in checking the columns for duplicates.\n\nWait, in Option A, the columns are all unique, as I saw.\n\nIn Option D, let me check the columns:\n\nColumn1: same as A.\n\nColumn2: same as A.\n\nColumn3: same as A.\n\nColumn4: same as A.\n\nColumn5: same as A.\n\nColumn6: different.\n\nSo, in D, all columns are unique.\n\nWait, but perhaps in D, some other rule is violated.\n\nWait, let me check Option D's Row6: 0 1 1 0 1 1.\n\nSo, that's 0,1,1,0,1,1.\n\nSo, looking at the end, two 1s. That's allowed.\n\nBut, wait, let me check the entire row for three in a row. 0,1,1,0,1,1.\n\nNo three in a row. So that's okay.\n\nHmm, maybe both A and D are correct? But the problem says only one is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed something else. Let me check Option A's columns again.\n\nWait, in Option A, Column6 is 1,0,1,1,0,0.\n\nSo, 1,0,1,1,0,0.\n\nThat has two 1s in the middle (positions 3 and 4), and two 0s at the end (5 and 6). So, allowed.\n\nIn Option D, Column6 is 1,0,1,1,0,1.\n\nWhich is 1,0,1,1,0,1. So, two 1s in positions 3 and 4, then a 0, then a 1. So, allowed.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check the uniqueness of the rows and columns more carefully.\n\nLooking at Option A:\n\nRows:\n\nRow1:1 0 0 1 0 1\n\nRow2:1 1 0 0 1 0\n\nRow3:0 0 1 1 0 1\n\nRow4:0 0 1 0 1 1\n\nRow5:1 1 0 1 0 0\n\nRow6:0 1 1 0 1 0\n\nAll rows are different.\n\nColumns:\n\nColumn1:1 1 0 0 1 0\n\nColumn2:0 1 0 0 1 1\n\nColumn3:0 0 1 1 0 1\n\nColumn4:1 0 1 0 1 0\n\nColumn5:0 1 0 1 0 1\n\nColumn6:1 0 1 1 0 0\n\nAll columns are different.\n\nOption D:\n\nRows:\n\nRow1: same as A.\n\nRow2: same as A.\n\nRow3: same as A.\n\nRow4: same as A.\n\nRow5: same as A.\n\nRow6:0 1 1 0 1 1\n\nSo, rows 1-5 are same as A, row6 is different.\n\nSo, no duplicate rows in D.\n\nColumns:\n\nColumn1: same as A.\n\nColumn2: same as A.\n\nColumn3: same as A.\n\nColumn4: same as A.\n\nColumn5: same as A.\n\nColumn6:1 0 1 1 0 1.\n\nSo, columns are unique.\n\nSo, both A and D seem to satisfy all the rules.\n\nBut the problem states that there is a correct answer, so I must have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps one of the options has a row or column with three in a row.\n\nWait, in Option D, let me check Row6: 0 1 1 0 1 1.\n\nThat's 0,1,1,0,1,1. So, two 1s at the end. That's okay.\n\nIn Option A, Row6 is 0 1 1 0 1 0. So, two 1s in the middle, then a 0. That's okay.\n\nWait, but let me check the columns again for three in a row.\n\nIn Option A, Column6 is 1,0,1,1,0,0.\n\nSo, positions 3 and 4 are 1s, then 0s. No three.\n\nIn Option D, Column6 is 1,0,1,1,0,1. Again, two 1s, then 0, then 1. No three.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to check if the rows and columns are unique across the entire grid.\n\nWait, in Option A, each row is unique, and each column is unique.\n\nIn Option D, same, except Row6 is different, but columns are still unique.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the correct answer is among the options, so perhaps I missed something else.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check if the number of 1s and 0s is correct.\n\nIn Option A, each row and column has exactly 3 of each. So that's fine.\n\nIn Option D, same.\n\nWait, maybe I should check for the columns in Option D.\n\nWait, let me check Column6 in D: 1,0,1,1,0,1.\n\nSo, that's 1,0,1,1,0,1. Let's count the 1s: positions 1,3,4,6 → four 1s. Oh no! That's four 1s in Column6, which would mean two 0s. So, that's invalid because each column must have exactly 3 ones and 3 zeros.\n\nWait, let me recount.\n\nColumn6 in D:\n\nRow1:1\n\nRow2:0\n\nRow3:1\n\nRow4:1\n\nRow5:0\n\nRow6:1\n\nSo, 1,0,1,1,0,1.\n\nNumber of 1s: 1,3,4,6 → four 1s. That's four, which means two 0s. So, that's 4 ones and 2 zeros, which violates rule 3. So, Option D is invalid.\n\nWait, that's a mistake I made earlier. So, Option D's Column6 has four 1s, which is incorrect.\n\nSo, Option D is invalid because Column6 has four 1s. So, the correct answer must be Option A.\n\nWait, let me confirm Column6 in D:\n\nLooking at Option D's grid:\n\nRow1:1 0 0 1 0 1 → Column6:1\n\nRow2:1 1 0 0 1 0 → Column6:0\n\nRow3:0 0 1 1 0 1 → Column6:1\n\nRow4:0 0 1 0 1 1 → Column6:1\n\nRow5:1 1 0 1 0 0 → Column6:0\n\nRow6:0 1 1 0 1 1 → Column6:1\n\nSo, adding them up: 1+0+1+1+0+1 = 4 ones. So yes, four ones, which violates the rule. So, Option D is invalid.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is Option A.\n</think>\n\nThe correct answer is Option A, as it satisfies all the rules of the Binairo puzzle without any violations.\n\n\\boxed{A}", "ground_truth": "A", "prompt": "You need to solve a Binairo puzzle (Size: 6x6).You need to solve a Binairo puzzle.\n\n**Binairo Puzzle Rules:**\n1.

So I need to check for duplicate rows and duplicate columns.\n\nAlright, let's start with Option A.\n\n**Option A:**\n\nRows:\n1. 0 1 1 0 1 0\n   - No three in a row. Let's count: 0,1,1,0,1,0. Two 1s in a row, but no three. Good.\n   - Count of 0s: 3, 1s: 3. Good.\n\n2. 1 1 0 1 0 0\n   - 1,1,0,1,0,0. Again, two 1s, two 0s. No three in a row.\n   - Count: 3 0s, 3 1s.\n\n3. 0 0 1 0 1 1\n   - 0,0,1,0,1,1. Two 0s, two 1s. Good.\n   - Count: 3 0s, 3 1s.\n\n4. 1 1 0 0 1 0\n   - 1,1,0,0,1,0. Two 1s, two 0s. Good.\n   - Count: 3 0s, 3 1s.\n\n5. 1 0 0 1 0 1\n   - 1,0,0,1,0,1. Two 0s, no three. Good.\n   - Count: 3 0s, 3 1s.\n\n6. 0 0 1 1 0 1\n   - 0,0,1,1,0,1. Two 0s, two 1s. Good.\n   - Count: 3 0s, 3 1s.\n\nNow, check columns for each column:\n\nColumn 1:\n0,1,0,1,1,0\nLooking for three same in a row. 0,1,0,1,1,0. No three same consecutive.\n\nColumn 2:\n1,1,0,1,0,0\nAgain, 1,1,0,1,0,0. No three same.\n\nColumn 3:\n1,0,1,0,0,1\n1,0,1,0,0,1. No three same.\n\nColumn 4:\n0,1,0,0,1,1\n0,1,0,0,1,1. No three same.\n\nColumn 5:\n1,0,1,1,0,0\n1,0,1,1,0,0. Two 1s, then two 0s. Good.\n\nColumn 6:\n0,0,1,0,1,1\n0,0,1,0,1,1. Two 0s, two 1s. Good.\n\nNext, check for duplicate rows. Let's list each row:\n\nRow1: 0 1 1 0 1 0\nRow2: 1 1 0 1 0 0\nRow3: 0 0 1 0 1 1\nRow4: 1 1 0 0 1 0\nRow5: 1 0 0 1 0 1\nRow6: 0 0 1 1 0 1\n\nLooking at these, all seem unique. For example, Row1 is different from Row2, Row3, etc. So no duplicate rows.\n\nCheck columns for duplicates. Let's look at each column as a vector:\n\nCol1: 0,1,0,1,1,0\nCol2: 1,1,0,1,0,0\nCol3: 1,0,1,0,0,1\nCol4: 0,1,0,0,1,1\nCol5: 1,0,1,1,0,0\nCol6: 0,0,1,0,1,1\n\nEach column seems unique as well. So Option A satisfies all the rules so far. But let's check the other options to make sure.\n\n**Option B:**\n\nLooking at Option B's first row: 1 1 1 0 1 0. Wait, that has three 1s in a row at the beginning. That violates rule 2, which says no more than two consecutive identical numbers. So Option B is invalid. I don't need to check further.\n\n**Option C:**\n\nLooking at Option C's rows:\n\nRow1: 0 1 1 0 1 0 - same as Option A's Row1. So let's check columns for duplicates.\n\nWait, before that, let me check if any rows are duplicates. Option C's Row4 is 1 1 0 1 1 0. Wait, let me look:\n\nRow1: 0 1 1 0 1 0\nRow2: 1 1 0 1 0 0\nRow3: 0 0 1 0 1 1\nRow4: 1 1 0 1 1 0\nRow5: 1 0 0 1 0 1\nRow6: 0 0 1 1 0 1\n\nRow4 is different from others, so no duplicate rows.\n\nNow, check columns for duplicates.\n\nBut before that, check for any rule violations.\n\nLooking at Row4: 1 1 0 1 1 0. Let's see if there's three in a row. The first two are 1s, then 0, then 1,1,0. So no three in a row. So that's okay.\n\nCheck columns:\n\nColumn1:\n0,1,0,1,1,0\nSame as Option A's Column1.\n\nColumn2:\n1,1,0,1,0,0\nSame as Option A's Column2.\n\nWait, so if columns are identical to A, which has unique columns, then in Option C, columns would have duplicates with A's columns. But wait, Option C is a separate option, so maybe its columns are unique among themselves.\n\nWait, let me check all columns in Option C:\n\nColumn1: 0,1,0,1,1,0\nColumn2: 1,1,0,1,0,0\nColumn3: 1,0,1,0,0,1\nColumn4: 0,1,0,1,1,1\nWait, let's see:\n\nWait, Option C's Row4 is 1 1 0 1 1 0, so Column4 for Option C is:\n\nRow1: 0\nRow2:1\nRow3:0\nRow4:1\nRow5:1\nRow6:1\n\nSo Column4 is 0,1,0,1,1,1. That has three 1s at the end. So that's three consecutive 1s, which violates rule 2. So Option C is invalid.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Column4 in Option C:\n\nRow1: 0\nRow2:1\nRow3:0\nRow4:1\nRow5:1\nRow6:1\n\nSo the last three entries are 1,1,1. That's three 1s in a row, which is not allowed. So Option C is invalid.\n\n**Option D:**\n\nNow, checking Option D.\n\nLooking at Option D's rows:\n\nRow1: 0 1 1 0 1 0\nRow2:1 1 0 1 0 0\nRow3:0 0 1 0 1 1\nRow4:1 1 0 0 1 0\nRow5:1 0 0 1 0 1\nRow6:0 0 1 1 0 0\n\nFirst, check for any three in a row.\n\nRow6: 0 0 1 1 0 0. So the last two are 0s, no three. Good.\n\nNow, check columns.\n\nColumn1:\n0,1,0,1,1,0\nNo three in a row.\n\nColumn2:\n1,1,0,1,0,0\nNo three in a row.\n\nColumn3:\n1,0,1,0,0,1\nNo three in a row.\n\nColumn4:\n0,1,0,0,1,1\nNo three in a row.\n\nColumn5:\n1,0,1,1,0,0\nNo three in a row.\n\nColumn6:\n0,0,1,0,1,0\nWait, Column6 in Option D: 0,0,1,0,1,0. So first two are 0s, then 1, then 0,1,0. So no three in a row.\n\nWait, but let's look at Row6: 0 0 1 1 0 0. That's two 0s, then two 1s, then two 0s. So no three in a row.\n\nNow, check counts for each row:\n\nRow1: 3 0s, 3 1s.\nRow2: 3 0s, 3 1s.\nRow3: 3 0s, 3 1s.\nRow4: 3 0s, 3 1s.\nRow5: 3 0s, 3 1s.\nRow6: 3 0s, 3 1s.\nGood.\n\nNow, check for duplicate rows.\n\nOption D's rows:\n\nRow1: 0 1 1 0 1 0\nRow2:1 1 0 1 0 0\nRow3:0 0 1 0 1 1\nRow4:1 1 0 0 1 0\nRow5:1 0 0 1 0 1\nRow6:0 0 1 1 0 0\n\nLooking at these, all rows seem unique. For example, Row6 ends with 0,0, which is different from others.\n\nNow, check columns for duplicates.\n\nLooking at each column as a vector:\n\nColumn1: 0,1,0,1,1,0\nColumn2:1,1,0,1,0,0\nColumn3:1,0,1,0,0,1\nColumn4:0,1,0,0,1,1\nColumn5:1,0,1,1,0,0\nColumn6:0,0,1,0,1,0\n\nNow, check if any columns are duplicates. Let's compare:\n\nColumn1: 0,1,0,1,1,0\nColumn2:1,1,0,1,0,0\nColumn3:1,0,1,0,0,1\nColumn4:0,1,0,0,1,1\nColumn5:1,0,1,1,0,0\nColumn6:0,0,1,0,1,0\n\nLooking at these, each column seems unique. For example, Column1 is different from Column2, etc.\n\nWait, but let me check Column6 in Option D: 0,0,1,0,1,0. Is there any other column like that? No, others are different.\n\nNow, check if all rules are satisfied for Option D.\n\nWait, but wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me check Option D's Column5 again.\n\nIn Option D, Column5 is:\n\nRow1:1\nRow2:0\nRow3:1\nRow4:1\nRow5:0\nRow6:0\n\nSo Column5 is 1,0,1,1,0,0. That's correct, no three in a row.\n\nBut wait, in Option D, Row6 is 0 0 1 1 0 0. That's okay, but let's check Column6: 0,0,1,0,1,0. That's okay.\n\nBut wait, I need to check for duplicate columns. Let me see if any two columns are the same.\n\nLooking at Column1: 0,1,0,1,1,0\nColumn2:1,1,0,1,0,0\nColumn3:1,0,1,0,0,1\nColumn4:0,1,0,0,1,1\nColumn5:1,0,1,1,0,0\nColumn6:0,0,1,0,1,0\n\nLooking at Column1 and Column6: Column1 is 0,1,0,1,1,0; Column6 is 0,0,1,0,1,0. Different.\n\nSimilarly, Column2 and Column3: Column2 is 1,1,0,1,0,0; Column3 is 1,0,1,0,0,1. Different.\n\nSo no duplicate columns.\n\nBut wait, let me check if any other options have the same columns as in Option D. For example, in Option A, the columns were unique, but in Option D, they're also unique. So that's fine.\n\nWait, but I'm supposed to choose from the options given, and I've already found that Option A satisfies all the rules, and Options B and C are invalid, and Option D also seems valid. Hmm, that's a problem because the question says only one correct answer.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check Option D again.\n\nWait, in Option D, Row6 is 0 0 1 1 0 0. That's okay, but let's check the columns again.\n\nWait, Column4 in Option D is 0,1,0,0,1,1. That's okay.\n\nWait, but in Option D, Row6 is 0 0 1 1 0 0. So the last two cells are 0s, which is fine, but let's check if any column has three 0s or 1s in a row.\n\nWait, Column6 in Option D: 0,0,1,0,1,0. So 0,0, then 1, then 0,1,0. No three in a row.\n\nSimilarly, Column5: 1,0,1,1,0,0. So two 1s, then two 0s. No three in a row.\n\nWait, but I think I might have missed something in Option A. Let me check Option A again.\n\nIn Option A, Row4 is 1 1 0 0 1 0. So columns 1-6:\n\nLooking at Column4 in Option A: 0,1,0,0,1,0. So 0,1,0,0,1,0. No three in a row. Good.\n\nWait, but now I'm confused because both Option A and D seem to satisfy the rules. But the question says only one correct answer, so I must have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, let me check Option D again for duplicates. Let me compare Option A and D.\n\nIn Option A, Column6 is 0,0,1,0,1,1. In Option D, Column6 is 0,0,1,0,1,0. So different.\n\nBut wait, in Option D, Row6 is 0 0 1 1 0 0. So two 0s, then two 1s, then two 0s. No three in a row. Good.\n\nBut let me check the counts again for each row and column in Option D.\n\nEach row in D has three 0s and three 1s. Each column as well.\n\nWait, but maybe I missed a duplicate row or column.\n\nLooking at Option D's rows:\n\nRow1: 0 1 1 0 1 0\nRow2:1 1 0 1 0 0\nRow3:0 0 1 0 1 1\nRow4:1 1 0 0 1 0\nRow5:1 0 0 1 0 1\nRow6:0 0 1 1 0 0\n\nThese all look unique.\n\nColumns in D:\n\nColumn1:0,1,0,1,1,0\nColumn2:1,1,0,1,0,0\nColumn3:1,0,1,0,0,1\nColumn4:0,1,0,0,1,1\nColumn5:1,0,1,1,0,0\nColumn6:0,0,1,0,1,0\n\nAll columns unique.\n\nWait, but in the initial analysis, Option A also satisfied all the rules. So maybe both A and D are correct, but the question says there's only one correct answer, so perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me check Option D again for any possible three in a row.\n\nLooking at Column4 in D:0,1,0,0,1,1. So the last three are 0,1,1. Wait, no, it's 0,0,1,1. Wait, no, Column4 in D is:\n\nRow1:0\nRow2:1\nRow3:0\nRow4:0\nRow5:1\nRow6:1\n\nSo the entries are 0,1,0,0,1,1. So from Row4 to Row6: 0,1,1. That's two 1s at the end. No three in a row.\n\nWait, but I'm starting to think maybe both A and D are correct, but since the options are given, perhaps the correct answer is A because in D, let's check the columns for duplicates with A.\n\nWait, in Option A, the columns are:\n\nCol1:0,1,0,1,1,0\nCol2:1,1,0,1,0,0\nCol3:1,0,1,0,0,1\nCol4:0,1,0,0,1,1\nCol5:1,0,1,1,0,0\nCol6:0,0,1,0,1,1\n\nIn Option D, the columns are:\n\nCol1:0,1,0,1,1,0\nCol2:1,1,0,1,0,0\nCol3:1,0,1,0,0,1\nCol4:0,1,0,0,1,1\nCol5:1,0,1,1,0,0\nCol6:0,0,1,0,1,0\n\nSo Col1 in D is same as Col1 in A. That would mean that in the puzzle, if Option A is correct, then Option D has the same first column, which would be a duplicate column, violating rule 4. But since each option is a separate grid, I think each option is considered independently. So within each option, the columns and rows must be unique. So if Option D has all unique rows and columns, it's a possible solution.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the solution\", implying only one correct answer. So maybe I need to check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in checking Option D's columns. Let me check if any column in D has three in a row.\n\nLooking at Column5 in D:1,0,1,1,0,0. So two 1s in a row, then two 0s. No problem.\n\nWait, but in Column4 of D:0,1,0,0,1,1. The last two are 1s, so two in a row. Okay.\n\nWait, but in Option D, Row6 is 0 0 1 1 0 0. So two 0s, two 1s, two 0s. That's fine.\n\nWait, I'm starting to think that both A and D satisfy all the rules, but perhaps I made a mistake in checking.\n\nWait, let me check the number of 0s and 1s in each row and column for both options.\n\nFor Option A:\n\nEach row has 3 0s and 3 1s. Each column as well.\n\nFor Option D:\n\nSame, each row and column has 3 0s and 3 1s.\n\nNow, checking for duplicate rows and columns within each option.\n\nIn Option A, all rows are unique, all columns are unique.\n\nIn Option D, same.\n\nBut wait, perhaps in Option D, some columns are duplicates of each other or with rows. Wait, no, each column in D is unique.\n\nWait, but the problem is that both A and D seem to satisfy all the rules, which can't be the case because the question expects one correct answer. So perhaps I made a mistake in checking one of them.\n\nWait, let me check Option A's Column4 again. In Option A, Column4 is:\n\nRow1:0\nRow2:1\nRow3:0\nRow4:0\nRow5:1\nRow6:0\n\nSo 0,1,0,0,1,0. That's okay, no three in a row.\n\nWait, but in Option D, Column4 is 0,1,0,0,1,1. So two 1s at the end. No three in a row.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to check for another rule that I missed.\n\nWait, another possibility: maybe the number of 0s and 1s in each row and column. Let me recount for Option D.\n\nOption D's rows:\n\nRow1: 0,1,1,0,1,0 → 3 0s, 3 1s.\n\nRow2:1,1,0,1,0,0 → 3 0s, 3 1s.\n\nRow3:0,0,1,0,1,1 → 3 0s, 3 1s.\n\nRow4:1,1,0,0,1,0 → 3 0s, 3 1s.\n\nRow5:1,0,0,1,0,1 → 3 0s, 3 1s.\n\nRow6:0,0,1,1,0,0 → 3 0s, 3 1s.\n\nGood.\n\nColumns in D:\n\nColumn1:0,1,0,1,1,0 → 3 0s, 3 1s.\n\nColumn2:1,1,0,1,0,0 → 3 0s, 3 1s.\n\nColumn3:1,0,1,0,0,1 → 3 0s, 3 1s.\n\nColumn4:0,1,0,0,1,1 → 3 0s, 3 1s.\n\nColumn5:1,0,1,1,0,0 → 3 0s, 3 1s.\n\nColumn6:0,0,1,0,1,0 → 3 0s, 3 1s.\n\nAll correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check for duplicate rows or columns within the same option.\n\nIn Option D, looking at the rows:\n\nRow1: 0 1 1 0 1 0\nRow2:1 1 0 1 0 0\nRow3:0 0 1 0 1 1\nRow4:1 1 0 0 1 0\nRow5:1 0 0 1 0 1\nRow6:0 0 1 1 0 0\n\nThese all seem unique. For example, Row1 is different from Row2, etc.\n\nSimilarly, columns are unique.\n\nWait, but then both Option A and D satisfy all the rules. That can't be, so I must have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for more clues. Let me check the initial problem again.\n\nWait, the problem says that in the options, each cell is represented by 0 or 1, and the red is 1, blue is 0. So perhaps the initial setup has some clues, but since I don't have the initial setup, I can't use that.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check for any other rule that I might have missed, like the pattern of the numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is A because D has a column that has three 1s somewhere, but I don't think so.\n\nWait, let me check Option D's Column5 again: 1,0,1,1,0,0. So two 1s, then two 0s. No three in a row.\n\nWait, I'm stuck. Both A and D seem correct, but perhaps I made a mistake in checking one of them.\n\nWait, let me check Option D's Row4:1 1 0 0 1 0. So two 1s, two 0s, then 1,0. No three in a row.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for any other rule that I missed, like the arrangement of 0s and 1s in a way that can't be solved.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check the initial clues, but since I don't have them, I can't.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct answer is A, as it's the first option that I found to satisfy all rules, and maybe D has an issue I haven't noticed.\n\nWait, in Option D, Column6 is 0,0,1,0,1,0. So the first two are 0s, then 1, then 0,1,0. No three in a row.\n\nWait, I'm really stuck here. Both options seem correct, but perhaps I made a mistake in checking Option D's columns for duplicates.\n\nWait, looking at Option D's Column6:0,0,1,0,1,0.\n\nIs there any other column in D that matches this? Let me check:\n\nColumn1:0,1,0,1,1,0 → No.\nColumn2:1,1,0,1,0,0 → No.\nColumn3:1,0,1,0,0,1 → No.\nColumn4:0,1,0,0,1,1 → No.\nColumn5:1,0,1,1,0,0 → No.\nSo Column6 is unique.\n\nSimilarly, all columns are unique.\n\nWait, perhaps the answer is A because in Option D, there's a row that's duplicated in another option, but no, each option is separate.\n\nWait, I think I have to go with Option A because when I first checked it, it satisfied all the rules, and I didn't find any issues. So I'll choose A.\n</think>\n\nThe correct answer is Option A.\n\n**Answer:**\n\\boxed{A}", "ground_truth": "A", "prompt": "You need to solve a Binairo puzzle (Size: 6x6).You need to solve a Binairo puzzle.\n\n**Binairo Puzzle Rules:**\n1.

{"question_id": "binairo_665", "response": "Alright, so I've got this Binairo puzzle to solve, and I need to figure out which of the four options (A, B, C, D) is the correct solution. Let me start by recalling the rules to make sure I don't miss anything.\n\nFirst, each cell must be either a 0 or a 1. That's straightforward. Next, no more than two consecutive identical numbers in any row or column. So, I can't have three 0s or 1s in a row anywhere. Then, each row and column must have an equal number of 0s and 1s. Since it's a 4x4 grid, each row and column must have exactly two 0s and two 1s. Lastly, no two rows or columns can be identical. That means all four rows must be unique, and all four columns must be unique as well.\n\nOkay, let's go through each option one by one and check these rules.\n\n**Option A:**\n```\n1 0 0 1\n1 1 0 0\n0 0 1 1\n0 1 1 0\n```\n\nLet me check the rows first.\n\nRow 1: 1,0,0,1. That's two 0s and two 1s. Also, no three in a row. Looks good.\n\nRow 2: 1,1,0,0. Two 1s followed by two 0s. No three in a row. Good.\n\nRow 3: 0,0,1,1. Same as above. No three in a row. Good.\n\nRow 4: 0,1,1,0. Again, two 1s in the middle. No three in a row. Good.\n\nNow, checking for identical rows. All four rows are different, so that's fine.\n\nNow, let's check the columns.\n\nColumn 1: 1,1,0,0. Two 1s followed by two 0s. No three in a row. Good.\n\nColumn 2: 0,1,0,1. Alternating, so no consecutive duplicates. Good.\n\nColumn 3: 0,0,1,1. Two 0s followed by two 1s. No three in a row. Good.\n\nColumn 4: 1,0,1,0. Alternating, so no consecutive duplicates. Good.\n\nNow, checking if any columns are identical. Column 1 is 1,1,0,0; Column 2 is 0,1,0,1; Column 3 is 0,0,1,1; Column 4 is 1,0,1,0. All unique. So Option A seems to satisfy all the rules.\n\nBut wait, let me check Option B just to be thorough.\n\n**Option B:**\n```\n0 0 0 1\n1 1 0 0\n0 0 1 1\n0 1 1 0\n```\n\nStarting with the rows.\n\nRow 1: 0,0,0,1. Oh no, there are three 0s in a row. That's a violation of rule 2. So Option B is invalid right away. I can skip checking the rest.\n\n**Option C:**\n```\n1 0 0 1\n1 1 0 0\n0 0 0 1\n0 1 1 0\n```\n\nChecking rows first.\n\nRow 1: 1,0,0,1. Good.\n\nRow 2: 1,1,0,0. Good.\n\nRow 3: 0,0,0,1. Oh, three 0s in a row. That's a violation. So Option C is invalid.\n\n**Option D:**\n```\n1 0 0 1\n1 1 0 0\n0 0 1 1\n0 1 1 1\n```\n\nRows:\n\nRow 1: Good.\n\nRow 2: Good.\n\nRow 3: Good.\n\nRow 4: 0,1,1,1. There are three 1s at the end. That's a violation. So Option D is invalid.\n\nSo, from this initial check, only Option A is valid based on the consecutive numbers and row counts. But wait, let me double-check the columns for Option A.\n\nColumn 1: 1,1,0,0. Two 1s, two 0s. No three in a row. Good.\n\nColumn 2: 0,1,0,1. Alternating, so no consecutive duplicates. Good.\n\nColumn 3: 0,0,1,1. Two 0s, two 1s. Good.\n\nColumn 4: 1,0,1,0. Alternating. Good.\n\nAnd all columns are unique. So Option A passes all the checks. But wait, let me check the uniqueness of the rows and columns again.\n\nRows:\n\n1. 1,0,0,1\n\n2. 1,1,0,0\n\n3. 0,0,1,1\n\n4. 0,1,1,0\n\nAre any of these rows identical? No, all four are different. Good.\n\nColumns:\n\n1. 1,1,0,0\n\n2. 0,1,0,1\n\n3. 0,0,1,1\n\n4. 1,0,1,0\n\nAll four columns are different. So that's good.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something else. The problem statement says \"each column must contain an equal number of 0s and 1s.\" So each column must have exactly two 0s and two 1s. Let me confirm that.\n\nFor Option A:\n\nColumn 1: 1,1,0,0 → two 1s, two 0s. Good.\n\nColumn 2: 0,1,0,1 → two 0s, two 1s. Good.\n\nColumn 3: 0,0,1,1 → two 0s, two 1s. Good.\n\nColumn 4: 1,0,1,0 → two 1s, two 0s. Good.\n\nSo all columns satisfy the count requirement. Okay, that's solid.\n\nJust to make sure, let me think if there's any other rule I might have missed. No, I think I covered all the rules: no three in a row, equal number of 0s and 1s, unique rows and columns. Option A passes all.\n\nBut wait a second, let me check Option C again because sometimes it's easy to miss something.\n\nOption C had Row 3 as 0,0,0,1 which is invalid, so it's out. So no, I was right earlier. Only Option A is valid.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer must be Option A.\n</think>\n\nThe correct answer is determined by evaluating each option against the Binairo rules. Option A satisfies all conditions, while the others have violations such as too many consecutive numbers or incorrect counts. \n\n**Answer:**\n\\boxed{A}", "ground_truth": "A", "prompt": "You need to solve a Binairo puzzle (Size: 4x4).You need to solve a Binairo puzzle.\n\n**Binairo Puzzle Rules:**\n1.

{"question_id": "binairo_526", "response": "Alright, let me try to solve this Binairo puzzle. So, I'm given a 6x6 grid and four options (A, B, C, D). I need to figure out which one is the correct solution based on the rules provided. Let me go through each rule and see how it applies to each option.\n\nFirst, let's recap the rules to make sure I don't miss anything:\n\n1. Each cell must be 0 or 1. Well, looking at all options, each cell is either 0 or 1, so that's satisfied in all.\n\n2. No more than two consecutive identical numbers in any row or column. So, I need to check each row and column for any triplets of 0s or 1s.\n\n3. Each row and column must contain an equal number of 0s and 1s. Since it's a 6x6 grid, each row and column should have exactly 3 zeros and 3 ones.\n\n4. No two rows can be identical, and no two columns can be identical. So, I need to check that all rows are unique and all columns are unique.\n\nOkay, let's start by checking each option one by one, starting with Option A.\n\n**Option A:**\n```\n0 0 1 0 1 1\n1 0 0 1 0 1\n1 1 0 1 0 0\n0 1 1 0 1 0\n1 0 1 0 0 1\n0 1 0 1 1 0\n```\n\nLet me check each row for consecutive duplicates.\n\nRow 1: 0 0 1 0 1 1\n- The first two are 0s, which is okay. Then 1, then 0, then 1, then 1. Wait, the last two are 1s. So that's two consecutive, which is allowed. So no triplet here.\n\nRow 2: 1 0 0 1 0 1\n- 1, then 0 0 (okay), then 1, 0, 1. No triplets.\n\nRow 3: 1 1 0 1 0 0\n- First two are 1s (okay), then 0, then 1, 0, 0 (ends with two 0s). No triplets.\n\nRow 4: 0 1 1 0 1 0\n- 0, then 1 1 (okay), 0, 1, 0. No triplets.\n\nRow 5: 1 0 1 0 0 1\n- 1, 0, 1, 0, then 0 0 (okay), then 1. No triplets.\n\nRow 6: 0 1 0 1 1 0\n- 0,1,0,1, then 1 1 (okay), then 0. No triplets.\n\nOkay, rows seem okay. Now check columns for consecutive duplicates.\n\nColumn 1:\n0\n1\n1\n0\n1\n0\nLooking down: 0,1,1 (so two 1s, okay), 0,1,0. No triplets.\n\nColumn 2:\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n1\nWait, Column 2 is 0,0,0. That's three 0s in a row. Oh, that's a problem. So Option A has a column with three 0s in a row. So that's invalid. Therefore, Option A is out.\n\nHmm, but let me confirm. The second column of Option A is:\n\nRow1:0, Row2:0, Row3:0, Row4:1, Row5:0, Row6:1.\n\nYes, the first three are 0s. So three in a row, which violates rule 2. So Option A is invalid.\n\nMoving on to Option B.\n\n**Option B:**\n```\n1 0 1 0 1 1\n1 0 0 1 0 1\n1 1 0 1 0 0\n0 1 1 0 1 0\n1 0 1 0 0 1\n0 1 0 1 1 0\n```\n\nLet me check each row first.\n\nRow 1:1 0 1 0 1 1\n- 1,0,1,0,1, then 1 1 (two 1s, okay). So no triplets.\n\nRow 2:1 0 0 1 0 1\n- 1,0 0 (okay), 1,0,1. No triplets.\n\nRow 3:1 1 0 1 0 0\n- 1 1 (okay), 0,1,0,0 (ends with two 0s). No triplets.\n\nRow 4:0 1 1 0 1 0\n- 0,1 1 (okay),0,1,0. No triplets.\n\nRow 5:1 0 1 0 0 1\n- 1,0,1,0,0 0 (wait, last two are 0s? Wait, row 5 is 1 0 1 0 0 1. So the last two are 0 and 1. So no triplets.\n\nWait, wait, row 5: positions 4 and 5 are 0 and 0? Let me check:\n\nRow 5:1,0,1,0,0,1. So positions 4,5,6 are 0,0,1. So two 0s, which is allowed.\n\nRow 6:0 1 0 1 1 0\n- 0,1,0,1,1 1 (two 1s, okay), then 0. So no triplets.\n\nOkay, rows are fine. Now check columns for consecutive duplicates.\n\nColumn 1:\n1\n1\n1\n0\n1\n0\nLooking down: 1,1,1. Oh, that's three 1s in a row. So Column 1 has three 1s. That's a problem. So Option B is invalid.\n\nWait, let me verify. Column 1 of Option B is:\n\nRow1:1, Row2:1, Row3:1, Row4:0, Row5:1, Row6:0.\n\nYes, the first three are 1s. So three in a row, violating rule 2. So Option B is out.\n\nMoving on to Option C.\n\n**Option C:**\n```\n0 0 1 0 1 1\n1 0 0 1 0 1\n1 1 0 1 0 0\n0 1 1 1 1 0\n1 0 1 0 0 1\n0 1 0 1 1 0\n```\n\nFirst, check each row for consecutive duplicates.\n\nRow 1:0 0 1 0 1 1\n- 0 0 (okay), 1,0,1,1 (two 1s, okay). No triplets.\n\nRow 2:1 0 0 1 0 1\n- 1,0 0 (okay),1,0,1. No triplets.\n\nRow 3:1 1 0 1 0 0\n- 1 1 (okay),0,1,0,0 (ends with two 0s). No triplets.\n\nRow 4:0 1 1 1 1 0\n- 0,1,1,1,1,0. Oh, look at that. The middle four are 1s. So 1,1,1,1. That's four in a row. That's a violation of rule 2. So Option C is invalid.\n\nWait, let me confirm:\n\nRow 4:0,1,1,1,1,0. So positions 2-5 are all 1s. So yes, four in a row. Definitely invalid.\n\nSo Option C is out.\n\nFinally, Option D.\n\n**Option D:**\n```\n0 0 1 0 1 1\n1 0 0 1 0 1\n1 1 0 1 0 0\n0 1 1 0 1 0\n1 0 1 0 0 1\n0 1 0 1 1 1\n```\n\nLet me check each row first.\n\nRow 1:0 0 1 0 1 1\n- 0 0 (okay),1,0,1,1 (two 1s, okay). No triplets.\n\nRow 2:1 0 0 1 0 1\n- 1,0 0 (okay),1,0,1. No triplets.\n\nRow 3:1 1 0 1 0 0\n- 1 1 (okay),0,1,0,0 (ends with two 0s). No triplets.\n\nRow 4:0 1 1 0 1 0\n- 0,1 1 (okay),0,1,0. No triplets.\n\nRow 5:1 0 1 0 0 1\n- 1,0,1,0,0 0 (wait, positions 4 and 5 are 0s. So two 0s, okay). Then 1. So no triplets.\n\nRow 6:0 1 0 1 1 1\n- 0,1,0,1,1 1 (two 1s, okay). So no triplets.\n\nOkay, rows seem okay. Now check columns.\n\nLet's go column by column.\n\nColumn 1:\n0\n1\n1\n0\n1\n0\nLooking down: 0,1,1,0,1,0. So no three in a row. Good.\n\nColumn 2:\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n1\nWait, Column 2: Row1:0, Row2:0, Row3:0, Row4:1, Row5:0, Row6:1. So the first three are 0s. That's three in a row. Oh no, that's a violation. So Option D has three 0s in Column 2.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Column 2 for Option D:\n\nRow1:0\nRow2:0\nRow3:0\nRow4:1\nRow5:0\nRow6:1\n\nYes, first three are 0s. So that's three consecutive, which is not allowed. So Option D is invalid.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Because in the initial analysis, I thought D was the only one left, but now it seems all options have issues. Hmm, that can't be right because the problem states that there is a correct answer among them.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in checking. Let me go back.\n\nWait, let me re-examine Option D's columns more carefully.\n\nOption D's columns:\n\nColumn 1: 0,1,1,0,1,0 → 0,1,1,0,1,0. No three in a row. So okay.\n\nColumn 2: 0,0,0,1,0,1. Oh, wait, that's three 0s. So that's a problem. So Option D is invalid.\n\nHmm, but if all options are invalid, that's not possible because the question says one of them is correct. So perhaps I made an error in checking.\n\nWait, let me go back to each option.\n\nStarting again:\n\nOption A: Column 2 has three 0s. Invalid.\n\nOption B: Column 1 has three 1s. Invalid.\n\nOption C: Row 4 has four 1s. Invalid.\n\nOption D: Column 2 has three 0s. Invalid.\n\nWait, so none of the options are valid? That can't be. Maybe I made a mistake in checking.\n\nWait, let me check Option D again. Maybe I misread the columns.\n\nOption D's grid:\n\nRow1:0 0 1 0 1 1\nRow2:1 0 0 1 0 1\nRow3:1 1 0 1 0 0\nRow4:0 1 1 0 1 0\nRow5:1 0 1 0 0 1\nRow6:0 1 0 1 1 1\n\nSo Column 2:\n\nRow1:0\nRow2:0\nRow3:0\nRow4:1\nRow5:0\nRow6:1\n\nSo indeed, the first three are 0s. So three in a row. So Option D is invalid.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake with Option C. Let me check its columns again.\n\nOption C's grid:\n\nRow1:0 0 1 0 1 1\nRow2:1 0 0 1 0 1\nRow3:1 1 0 1 0 0\nRow4:0 1 1 1 1 0\nRow5:1 0 1 0 0 1\nRow6:0 1 0 1 1 0\n\nSo Column 1:\n\n0,1,1,0,1,0 → No three in a row.\n\nColumn 2:\n\n0,0,0,1,0,1 → First three 0s. So three in a row. So Option C is invalid.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought Option C had a row with four 1s, which is also invalid. So Option C is invalid for two reasons.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Maybe I need to check each option again, perhaps I missed something.\n\nWait, let me check Option B again. Maybe I misread the columns.\n\nOption B's grid:\n\nRow1:1 0 1 0 1 1\nRow2:1 0 0 1 0 1\nRow3:1 1 0 1 0 0\nRow4:0 1 1 0 1 0\nRow5:1 0 1 0 0 1\nRow6:0 1 0 1 1 0\n\nSo Column 1:\n\n1,1,1,0,1,0 → First three 1s. So three in a row. So Option B is invalid.\n\nOption A:\n\nColumn 2: three 0s. Invalid.\n\nSo all options seem to have issues. But the problem states that one of them is correct. So perhaps I made a mistake in checking.\n\nWait, maybe I should check for the row and column counts of 0s and 1s. Maybe one of the options satisfies all the rules except for the consecutive, but perhaps I missed that.\n\nLet me check Option A again for row and column counts.\n\nOption A:\n\nEach row should have exactly 3 zeros and 3 ones.\n\nRow1: 0,0,1,0,1,1 → Count: 3 zeros, 3 ones. Okay.\n\nRow2:1,0,0,1,0,1 → 3 zeros, 3 ones.\n\nRow3:1,1,0,1,0,0 → 3 zeros, 3 ones.\n\nRow4:0,1,1,0,1,0 → 3 zeros, 3 ones.\n\nRow5:1,0,1,0,0,1 → 3 zeros, 3 ones.\n\nRow6:0,1,0,1,1,0 → 3 zeros, 3 ones.\n\nSo rows are okay. Now columns.\n\nColumn1: 0,1,1,0,1,0 → 3 zeros, 3 ones.\n\nColumn2:0,0,0,1,0,1 → 4 zeros, 2 ones. Oh! That's a problem. So column2 in Option A has 4 zeros and 2 ones, which violates rule 3. So Option A is invalid.\n\nWait, I thought I already found a problem with Option A's columns, but now I see it also fails rule 3. So definitely invalid.\n\nOption B:\n\nCheck row counts.\n\nRow1:1,0,1,0,1,1 → 3 ones, 3 zeros.\n\nSimilarly, all rows have 3 each.\n\nColumns:\n\nColumn1:1,1,1,0,1,0 → 4 ones, 2 zeros. So that's a problem. So Option B fails rule 3 as well.\n\nOption C:\n\nRows:\n\nEach row has 3 zeros and 3 ones.\n\nColumns:\n\nColumn1:0,1,1,0,1,0 → 3 zeros, 3 ones.\n\nColumn2:0,0,0,1,0,1 → 4 zeros, 2 ones. So again, column2 has unequal count. So Option C is invalid.\n\nOption D:\n\nRows: Each row has 3 zeros and 3 ones.\n\nColumns:\n\nColumn1:0,1,1,0,1,0 → 3 zeros, 3 ones.\n\nColumn2:0,0,0,1,0,1 → 4 zeros, 2 ones. So again, column2 is invalid.\n\nWait, so all options have either consecutive triplets or unequal counts. But the problem says one of them is correct. So perhaps I made a mistake in checking.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check if any option has all rows and columns unique, even if they have some issues.\n\nWait, let's check Option D's columns again.\n\nOption D's columns:\n\nColumn1:0,1,1,0,1,0 → No three in a row, and 3 zeros, 3 ones.\n\nColumn2:0,0,0,1,0,1 → Three 0s, which is invalid.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in counting. Let me count the zeros and ones in column2 of Option D.\n\nColumn2:\n\nRow1:0\n\nRow2:0\n\nRow3:0\n\nRow4:1\n\nRow5:0\n\nRow6:1\n\nSo that's four 0s and two 1s. So indeed, unequal. So Option D is invalid.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the grid.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the options as provided.\n\nOption D:\n\n```\n0 0 1 0 1 1\n1 0 0 1 0 1\n1 1 0 1 0 0\n0 1 1 0 1 0\n1 0 1 0 0 1\n0 1 0 1 1 1\n```\n\nWait, in row6 of Option D: 0 1 0 1 1 1\n\nSo the last three are 1s. That's three in a row. Oh! I didn't check that earlier. So row6 has three 1s at the end. So that's a violation of rule 2.\n\nSo Option D has both a column with three 0s and a row with three 1s. So definitely invalid.\n\nHmm, this is perplexing. All options seem to have issues. But the problem states that one of them is correct. So perhaps I made a mistake in transcribing the options.\n\nWait, let me check the options again as provided.\n\nOption A:\n0 0 1 0 1 1\n1 0 0 1 0 1\n1 1 0 1 0 0\n0 1 1 0 1 0\n1 0 1 0 0 1\n0 1 0 1 1 0\n\nOption B:\n1 0 1 0 1 1\n1 0 0 1 0 1\n1 1 0 1 0 0\n0 1 1 0 1 0\n1 0 1 0 0 1\n0 1 0 1 1 0\n\nOption C:\n0 0 1 0 1 1\n1 0 0 1 0 1\n1 1 0 1 0 0\n0 1 1 1 1 0\n1 0 1 0 0 1\n0 1 0 1 1 0\n\nOption D:\n0 0 1 0 1 1\n1 0 0 1 0 1\n1 1 0 1 0 0\n0 1 1 0 1 0\n1 0 1 0 0 1\n0 1 0 1 1 1\n\nWait, perhaps I should check if any option has both rows and columns with no more than two consecutive, equal counts, and unique rows and columns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check for unique rows and columns.\n\nLet me check Option A for unique rows.\n\nRows:\n\nRow1:0 0 1 0 1 1\n\nRow2:1 0 0 1 0 1\n\nRow3:1 1 0 1 0 0\n\nRow4:0 1 1 0 1 0\n\nRow5:1 0 1 0 0 1\n\nRow6:0 1 0 1 1 0\n\nAre any rows identical? Let's compare each pair.\n\nRow1 vs Row2: different.\n\nRow1 vs Row3: different.\n\nRow1 vs Row4: different.\n\nRow1 vs Row5: different.\n\nRow1 vs Row6: different.\n\nRow2 vs Row3: different.\n\nRow2 vs Row4: different.\n\nRow2 vs Row5: different.\n\nRow2 vs Row6: different.\n\nRow3 vs Row4: different.\n\nRow3 vs Row5: different.\n\nRow3 vs Row6: different.\n\nRow4 vs Row5: different.\n\nRow4 vs Row6: different.\n\nRow5 vs Row6: different.\n\nSo all rows are unique. Now check columns.\n\nColumns of Option A:\n\nColumn1:0,1,1,0,1,0\n\nColumn2:0,0,0,1,0,1\n\nColumn3:1,0,0,1,1,0\n\nColumn4:0,1,1,0,0,1\n\nColumn5:1,0,0,1,0,1\n\nColumn6:1,1,0,0,1,0\n\nAre any columns identical?\n\nCompare Column1 and Column2: different.\n\nColumn1 vs Column3: 0 vs 1 in first position.\n\nDifferent.\n\nColumn1 vs Column4: 0 vs 0, then 1 vs 1, etc. Wait, let's see:\n\nColumn1:0,1,1,0,1,0\n\nColumn4:0,1,1,0,0,1\n\nSo they start the same, but differ at the fifth and sixth elements. So different.\n\nColumn1 vs Column5: 0 vs 1 in first position.\n\nDifferent.\n\nColumn1 vs Column6: 0 vs 1 in first position.\n\nDifferent.\n\nNow Column2:0,0,0,1,0,1\n\nCompare to Column3:1,0,0,1,1,0\n\nDifferent.\n\nColumn2 vs Column4: 0 vs 0, 0 vs1, etc. Different.\n\nColumn2 vs Column5:0 vs1, etc. Different.\n\nColumn2 vs Column6:0 vs1, etc. Different.\n\nColumn3:1,0,0,1,1,0\n\nCompare to Column4:0,1,1,0,0,1\n\nDifferent.\n\nColumn3 vs Column5:1 vs1, 0 vs0, etc. Wait:\n\nColumn3:1,0,0,1,1,0\n\nColumn5:1,0,0,1,0,1\n\nCompare:\n\nRow1:1 vs1\n\nRow2:0 vs0\n\nRow3:0 vs0\n\nRow4:1 vs1\n\nRow5:1 vs0\n\nRow6:0 vs1\n\nSo they differ at positions 5 and 6. So different.\n\nColumn3 vs Column6:1 vs1, 0 vs0, 0 vs0, 1 vs0, etc. Wait:\n\nColumn3:1,0,0,1,1,0\n\nColumn6:1,1,0,0,1,0\n\nCompare:\n\nRow1:1 vs1\n\nRow2:0 vs1 → different.\n\nSo Column3 and Column6 are different.\n\nColumn4:0,1,1,0,0,1\n\nCompare to Column5:1,0,0,1,0,1\n\nDifferent.\n\nColumn4 vs Column6:0 vs1, etc. Different.\n\nColumn5:1,0,0,1,0,1\n\nCompare to Column6:1,1,0,0,1,0\n\nDifferent.\n\nSo all columns in Option A are unique.\n\nBut earlier, I found that Column2 of Option A has three 0s, which violates rule 2.\n\nWait, but according to the rules, each row and column must have exactly three 0s and 1s, and no more than two consecutive identical digits.\n\nSo Option A fails because of the three 0s in Column2, even though rows and columns are unique.\n\nHmm, so none of the options seem to satisfy all the rules. But the problem says one of them is correct. So perhaps I made a mistake in my analysis.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-examine Option D again. Maybe I missed something.\n\nOption D:\n\nRow6:0 1 0 1 1 1 → ends with three 1s. So that's invalid.\n\nSo Option D is out.\n\nWait, maybe I should check if any option has all the rules satisfied except for one, and perhaps that's the intended answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the consecutive digits.\n\nWait, let me check Option B again.\n\nOption B:\n\nRow1:1 0 1 0 1 1 → ends with two 1s. That's okay.\n\nRow2:1 0 0 1 0 1 → has two 0s, okay.\n\nRow3:1 1 0 1 0 0 → starts with two 1s, okay.\n\nRow4:0 1 1 0 1 0 → two 1s, okay.\n\nRow5:1 0 1 0 0 1 → two 0s, okay.\n\nRow6:0 1 0 1 1 0 → two 1s, okay.\n\nSo rows are okay.\n\nColumns:\n\nColumn1:1,1,1,0,1,0 → three 1s, invalid.\n\nSo Option B is out.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check if any option has all rows and columns with no more than two consecutive, equal counts, unique rows and columns, even if it's not perfect in other aspects.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look for the option that has the fewest violations, but the problem states that one of them is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in checking Option D's row6. Let me count the consecutive 1s.\n\nOption D, row6:0 1 0 1 1 1 → the last three are 1s. So that's three in a row. So invalid.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct answer is Option D, but I missed that it's actually valid. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the grid.\n\nOption D's grid:\n\nRow1:0 0 1 0 1 1\n\nRow2:1 0 0 1 0 1\n\nRow3:1 1 0 1 0 0\n\nRow4:0 1 1 0 1 0\n\nRow5:1 0 1 0 0 1\n\nRow6:0 1 0 1 1 1\n\nSo row6 ends with three 1s. So that's a problem.\n\nHmm, perhaps the answer is Option D, despite this issue, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check if any option has all the rules satisfied except for the consecutive triplet, but perhaps that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in checking the columns for Option A.\n\nOption A's column2:0,0,0,1,0,1. So three 0s, which is invalid.\n\nWait, but maybe I miscounted. Let me count the zeros:\n\nRow1:0\n\nRow2:0\n\nRow3:0\n\nRow4:1\n\nRow5:0\n\nRow6:1\n\nSo that's four zeros, right? Wait, no, it's six elements. Let me list them:\n\nPositions in column2:\n\nRow1:0\n\nRow2:0\n\nRow3:0\n\nRow4:1\n\nRow5:0\n\nRow6:1\n\nSo zeros are at rows 1,2,3,5 → four zeros. So indeed, four zeros and two ones. So column2 has unequal counts, which is invalid.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the problem might have a typo, but I can't do that. So perhaps the correct answer is Option D, even though it has a row with three 1s, but maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that maybe the columns are okay except for one, but that's not allowed.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check the number of 0s and 1s in each column for all options.\n\nOption A:\n\nColumn1:0,1,1,0,1,0 → 3 zeros, 3 ones.\n\nColumn2:0,0,0,1,0,1 → 4 zeros, 2 ones.\n\nSo invalid.\n\nOption B:\n\nColumn1:1,1,1,0,1,0 → 4 ones, 2 zeros.\n\nInvalid.\n\nOption C:\n\nColumn1:0,1,1,0,1,0 → 3 zeros, 3 ones.\n\nColumn2:0,0,0,1,0,1 → 4 zeros, 2 ones.\n\nInvalid.\n\nOption D:\n\nColumn1:0,1,1,0,1,0 → 3 zeros, 3 ones.\n\nColumn2:0,0,0,1,0,1 → 4 zeros, 2 ones.\n\nInvalid.\n\nSo all options have at least one column with unequal counts. So perhaps the correct answer is the one with the least issues, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assessment.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check each option for the number of 0s and 1s in each row and column, as well as consecutive triplets.\n\nLet me make a table for each option:\n\nOption A:\n\nRows: all have 3 0s and 3 1s.\n\nColumns:\n\nColumn1: 3 0s, 3 1s.\n\nColumn2:4 0s, 2 1s.\n\nColumn3: Let's see:\n\nColumn3:\n\nRow1:1\n\nRow2:0\n\nRow3:0\n\nRow4:1\n\nRow5:1\n\nRow6:0\n\nSo 3 zeros, 3 ones.\n\nColumn4:\n\nRow1:0\n\nRow2:1\n\nRow3:1\n\nRow4:0\n\nRow5:0\n\nRow6:1\n\n3 zeros, 3 ones.\n\nColumn5:\n\nRow1:1\n\nRow2:0\n\nRow3:0\n\nRow4:1\n\nRow5:0\n\nRow6:1\n\n3 zeros, 3 ones.\n\nColumn6:\n\nRow1:1\n\nRow2:1\n\nRow3:0\n\nRow4:0\n\nRow5:1\n\nRow6:0\n\n3 zeros, 3 ones.\n\nSo columns 1,3,4,5,6 have equal counts, but column2 has 4 0s, 2 1s. So invalid.\n\nOption B:\n\nRows: all have 3 0s, 3 1s.\n\nColumns:\n\nColumn1:4 1s, 2 0s. Invalid.\n\nColumn2:\n\nRow1:0\n\nRow2:0\n\nRow3:0\n\nRow4:1\n\nRow5:0\n\nRow6:1\n\n4 0s, 2 1s. Invalid.\n\nColumn3:\n\nRow1:1\n\nRow2:0\n\nRow3:0\n\nRow4:1\n\nRow5:1\n\nRow6:0\n\n3 0s, 3 1s.\n\nColumn4:\n\nRow1:0\n\nRow2:1\n\nRow3:1\n\nRow4:0\n\nRow5:0\n\nRow6:1\n\n3 0s, 3 1s.\n\nColumn5:\n\nRow1:1\n\nRow2:0\n\nRow3:0\n\nRow4:1\n\nRow5:0\n\nRow6:1\n\n3 0s, 3 1s.\n\nColumn6:\n\nRow1:1\n\nRow2:1\n\nRow3:0\n\nRow4:0\n\nRow5:1\n\nRow6:0\n\n3 0s, 3 1s.\n\nSo columns 3,4,5,6 are okay, but column1 and 2 are invalid.\n\nOption C:\n\nRows: all have 3 0s, 3 1s.\n\nColumns:\n\nColumn1:3 0s, 3 1s.\n\nColumn2:4 0s, 2 1s. Invalid.\n\nColumn3:\n\nRow1:1\n\nRow2:0\n\nRow3:0\n\nRow4:1\n\nRow5:1\n\nRow6:0\n\n3 0s, 3 1s.\n\nColumn4:\n\nRow1:0\n\nRow2:1\n\nRow3:1\n\nRow4:1\n\nRow5:0\n\nRow6:1\n\n3 0s, 3 1s.\n\nColumn5:\n\nRow1:1\n\nRow2:0\n\nRow3:0\n\nRow4:1\n\nRow5:0\n\nRow6:1\n\n3 0s, 3 1s.\n\nColumn6:\n\nRow1:1\n\nRow2:1\n\nRow3:0\n\nRow4:0\n\nRow5:1\n\nRow6:0\n\n3 0s, 3 1s.\n\nSo columns 1,3,4,5,6 are okay, but column2 is invalid.\n\nOption D:\n\nRows: all have 3 0s, 3 1s.\n\nColumns:\n\nColumn1:3 0s, 3 1s.\n\nColumn2:4 0s, 2 1s. Invalid.\n\nColumn3:\n\nRow1:1\n\nRow2:0\n\nRow3:0\n\nRow4:1\n\nRow5:1\n\nRow6:0\n\n3 0s, 3 1s.\n\nColumn4:\n\nRow1:0\n\nRow2:1\n\nRow3:1\n\nRow4:0\n\nRow5:0\n\nRow6:1\n\n3 0s, 3 1s.\n\nColumn5:\n\nRow1:1\n\nRow2:0\n\nRow3:0\n\nRow4:1\n\nRow5:0\n\nRow6:1\n\n3 0s, 3 1s.\n\nColumn6:\n\nRow1:1\n\nRow2:1\n\nRow3:0\n\nRow4:0\n\nRow5:1\n\nRow6:0\n\n3 0s, 3 1s.\n\nSo columns 1,3,4,5,6 are okay, but column2 is invalid.\n\nSo all options have exactly one column with unequal counts (column2), except Option B which has column1 and column2 with unequal counts.\n\nWait, but in Option A, column2 has 4 zeros, which is a problem, but column1 is okay.\n\nSimilarly, in Option B, column1 is bad, column2 is bad.\n\nHmm, perhaps the answer is Option D, even though it has a row with three 1s, but perhaps I made a mistake in checking.\n\nWait, no, Option D's row6 has three 1s, which is invalid.\n\nSo I'm stuck. All options seem to have issues. But the problem states that one of them is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in checking the columns for Option D.\n\nOption D's column2:\n\nRow1:0\n\nRow2:0\n\nRow3:0\n\nRow4:1\n\nRow5:0\n\nRow6:1\n\nSo that's four 0s and two 1s. So column2 is invalid.\n\nWait, maybe I should look for the option with the fewest violations. Option D has a row and a column with issues, while others have only column issues.\n\nBut perhaps the intended answer is Option D, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should check if any option has all rows and columns with exactly three 0s and 1s, no consecutive triplets, and unique rows and columns.\n\nWait, perhaps Option D is the only one where columns 1,3,4,5,6 are okay, except for column2, but it also has a row with three 1s.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that perhaps the problem allows for some leeway, but according to the rules, all must be satisfied.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check the initial problem statement again.\n\nWait, the user provided the options, and I need to choose the correct one. All options have issues, but perhaps I made a mistake in checking.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check Option D's row4.\n\nOption D's row4:0 1 1 0 1 0 → 0,1,1,0,1,0.

{"question_id": "binairo_1460", "response": "Okay, so I need to solve this Binairo puzzle, and there are four options to choose from: A, B, C, and D. Let me first recall the rules to make sure I don't make any mistakes.\n\nRule 1: Each cell must be 0 or 1. That's straightforward, so all options should already follow that since they're filled with 0s and 1s.\n\nRule 2: No more than two consecutive identical numbers in any row or column. So I need to check each row and column for any occurrence of three in a row, like 000 or 111.\n\nRule 3: Each row and column must have an equal number of 0s and 1s. Since it's a 6x6 grid, each row and column should have exactly 3 zeros and 3 ones.\n\nRule 4: No two rows can be identical, and no two columns can be identical. So I need to check that all rows are unique and all columns are unique.\n\nAlright, let me go through each option one by one and check these rules.\n\nStarting with Option A:\n\nOption A:\nRow 1: 0 1 0 0 1 1\nLet me check for consecutive duplicates. It starts with 0,1,0,0. So two 0s in a row, which is allowed. Then 1,1 at the end. So two 1s, which is okay. No three in a row. So Rule 2 is satisfied for this row.\n\nNext, count of 0s and 1s: 0 appears three times, 1 appears three times. So Rule 3 is satisfied.\n\nRow 2: 0 1 0 1 0 1\nConsecutive check: alternating, so no two same in a row, let alone three. Good. 0s and 1s each appear three times. Good.\n\nRow 3: 1 0 1 1 0 0\nConsecutive check: starts with 1,0,1, then two 1s, which is allowed. Then two 0s, allowed. So Rule 2 is okay. 0s and 1s each three times. Good.\n\nRow 4: 1 1 0 0 1 0\nConsecutive: two 1s, two 0s, then 1 and 0. All good. Counts: 3 zeros, 3 ones. Good.\n\nRow 5: 0 0 1 1 0 1\nConsecutive: two 0s, two 1s, then 0 and 1. Okay. Counts: 3 zeros, 3 ones. Good.\n\nRow 6: 1 0 1 0 1 0\nAlternating, no consecutive duplicates. 3 ones and 3 zeros. Good.\n\nNow, check for identical rows. Looking at each row:\n\nRow1: 0 1 0 0 1 1\nRow2: 0 1 0 1 0 1\nRow3: 1 0 1 1 0 0\nRow4: 1 1 0 0 1 0\nRow5: 0 0 1 1 0 1\nRow6: 1 0 1 0 1 0\n\nAll rows look unique. So Rule 4 is satisfied for rows.\n\nNow columns. Let's check each column.\n\nColumn1: 0,0,1,1,0,1\n\nLooking at Column1: 0,0,1,1,0,1. Are there any three in a row? Let's see: positions 1-2: 0,0; 3-4:1,1; 5-6:0,1. No three. So Rule 2 is okay.\n\nCounts: 0 appears three times (positions 1,2,5), 1 appears three times (positions 3,4,6). Good.\n\nColumn2: 1,1,0,1,0,0\n\nCheck for consecutive: 1,1 at the start – allowed. Then 0,1,0,0. No three in a row. Counts: 0 appears three times (positions 3,5,6), 1 appears three times (positions 1,2,4). Good.\n\nColumn3: 0,0,1,0,1,1\n\nConsecutive: 0,0 at the start – allowed. Then 1,0,1,1. The last two are 1s, which is allowed. So no three in a row. Counts: 0 appears three times (positions 1,2,4), 1 appears three times (positions 3,5,6). Good.\n\nColumn4: 0,1,1,0,1,0\n\nConsecutive: 1,1 in the middle – allowed. Then 0,1,0. No three. Counts: 0 appears three times (positions 1,4,6), 1 appears three times (positions 2,3,5). Good.\n\nColumn5: 1,0,0,1,0,1\n\nConsecutive: 0,0 in positions 2-3 – allowed. Then 1,0,1. No three in a row. Counts: 0 appears three times (positions 2,3,5), 1 appears three times (positions 1,4,6). Good.\n\nColumn6: 1,1,0,0,1,0\n\nConsecutive: 1,1 at start – allowed. 0,0 next – allowed. Then 1,0. No three. Counts: 0 appears three times (positions 3,4,6), 1 appears three times (positions 1,2,5). Good.\n\nNow, check for identical columns. Let's look at each column as a whole.\n\nColumn1: 0,0,1,1,0,1\nColumn2: 1,1,0,1,0,0\nColumn3: 0,0,1,0,1,1\nColumn4: 0,1,1,0,1,0\nColumn5: 1,0,0,1,0,1\nColumn6: 1,1,0,0,1,0\n\nLooking at each, they all seem unique. So Rule 4 is satisfied for columns.\n\nSo Option A passes all rules. But let's check the other options to make sure.\n\nMoving on to Option B:\n\nOption B:\nRow1: 1 1 0 0 1 1\nRow2: 0 1 0 1 0 1\nRow3: 1 0 1 1 0 0\nRow4: 1 1 0 0 1 0\nRow5: 0 0 1 1 0 1\nRow6: 1 0 1 0 1 0\n\nFirst, check each row for consecutive duplicates.\n\nRow1: 1,1,0,0,1,1. So starts with two 1s, then two 0s, then two 1s. No three in a row. Good.\n\nCounts: 3 ones, 3 zeros. Good.\n\nRow2: 0,1,0,1,0,1. Alternating, no consecutive duplicates. Good. Counts: 3 each. Good.\n\nRow3: 1,0,1,1,0,0. Consecutive: two 1s and two 0s at the end. Allowed. Counts: 3 each.\n\nRow4: 1,1,0,0,1,0. Two 1s, two 0s, then 1,0. Good. Counts: 3 each.\n\nRow5: 0,0,1,1,0,1. Two 0s, two 1s, then 0,1. Good. Counts: 3 each.\n\nRow6: 1,0,1,0,1,0. Alternating, good. Counts: 3 each.\n\nNow, check for identical rows. Compare each row:\n\nRow1: 1 1 0 0 1 1\nRow2: 0 1 0 1 0 1\nRow3: 1 0 1 1 0 0\nRow4: 1 1 0 0 1 0\nRow5: 0 0 1 1 0 1\nRow6: 1 0 1 0 1 0\n\nAll rows seem unique. So Rule 4 is satisfied for rows.\n\nNow columns. Let's check each column.\n\nColumn1: 1,0,1,1,0,1\n\nCheck for consecutive duplicates: 1,0,1,1 – so positions 3-4 are 1,1. Allowed. Then 0,1. So no three in a row. Good.\n\nCounts: 0s: positions 2,5 → only two. Wait, that's a problem. 0s: positions 2 and 5, so two 0s. 1s: positions 1,3,4,6 → four 1s. So counts are unequal. Rule 3 is violated here.\n\nWait, that's a big issue. So Column1 in Option B has only two 0s and four 1s. That's against Rule 3, which requires equal numbers. So Option B is invalid. I can eliminate Option B.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Column1 for Option B:\n\nRow1: 1\n\nRow2: 0\n\nRow3:1\n\nRow4:1\n\nRow5:0\n\nRow6:1\n\nSo values: 1,0,1,1,0,1. So 0s are at positions 2 and 5 → two 0s. 1s are at 1,3,4,6 → four 1s. So indeed, counts are unequal. So Option B is invalid.\n\nMoving on to Option C.\n\nOption C:\nRow1: 0 1 0 0 1 1\nRow2: 0 1 0 1 0 1\nRow3:1 0 1 1 0 0\nRow4:1 1 0 1 1 0\nRow5:0 0 1 1 0 1\nRow6:1 0 1 0 1 0\n\nFirst, check each row for consecutive duplicates.\n\nRow1: 0,1,0,0,1,1. Two 0s, two 1s. Good.\n\nRow2: 0,1,0,1,0,1. Alternating. Good.\n\nRow3:1,0,1,1,0,0. Two 1s, two 0s. Good.\n\nRow4:1,1,0,1,1,0. Two 1s, then 0, two 1s, 0. So no three in a row. Good.\n\nRow5:0,0,1,1,0,1. Two 0s, two 1s. Good.\n\nRow6:1,0,1,0,1,0. Alternating. Good.\n\nNow counts for each row: All rows have 3 zeros and 3 ones. So Rule 3 is satisfied.\n\nCheck for identical rows. Compare each row:\n\nRow1: 0 1 0 0 1 1\n\nRow2: 0 1 0 1 0 1\n\nRow3:1 0 1 1 0 0\n\nRow4:1 1 0 1 1 0\n\nRow5:0 0 1 1 0 1\n\nRow6:1 0 1 0 1 0\n\nAll rows seem unique. So Rule 4 is satisfied for rows.\n\nNow, columns. Let's check each column.\n\nColumn1: 0,0,1,1,0,1\n\nConsecutive duplicates: 0,0 at start – allowed. Then 1,1 – allowed. Then 0,1. So no three in a row. Good.\n\nCounts: 0s at positions 1,2,5 → three. 1s at 3,4,6 → three. Good.\n\nColumn2: 1,1,0,1,0,0\n\nConsecutive duplicates: 1,1 at start – allowed. Then 0,1,0,0 – no three. Good.\n\nCounts: 0s at positions 3,5,6 → three. 1s at 1,2,4 → three. Good.\n\nColumn3: 0,0,1,0,1,1\n\nConsecutive duplicates: 0,0 at start – allowed. Then 1,0,1,1 – two 1s at end. Allowed. Good.\n\nCounts: 0s at 1,2,4 → three. 1s at 3,5,6 → three. Good.\n\nColumn4: 0,1,1,1,1,0\n\nWait, Column4: Let's list them:\n\nRow1:0\n\nRow2:1\n\nRow3:1\n\nRow4:1\n\nRow5:1\n\nRow6:0\n\nSo Column4 is 0,1,1,1,1,0.\n\nLooking for consecutive duplicates: positions 2-5 are 1,1,1,1. That's four 1s in a row. Which violates Rule 2, as there can't be more than two consecutive identical numbers. So Option C is invalid because Column4 has four 1s in a row.\n\nTherefore, Option C is out.\n\nNow, Option D.\n\nOption D:\nRow1:0 1 0 0 1 1\nRow2:0 1 0 1 0 1\nRow3:1 0 1 1 0 0\nRow4:1 1 0 0 1 0\nRow5:0 0 1 1 0 1\nRow6:1 0 1 0 1 1\n\nFirst, check each row for consecutive duplicates.\n\nRow1:0,1,0,0,1,1. Two 0s, two 1s. Good.\n\nRow2:0,1,0,1,0,1. Alternating. Good.\n\nRow3:1,0,1,1,0,0. Two 1s, two 0s. Good.\n\nRow4:1,1,0,0,1,0. Two 1s, two 0s, then 1,0. Good.\n\nRow5:0,0,1,1,0,1. Two 0s, two 1s. Good.\n\nRow6:1,0,1,0,1,1. Consecutive: last two are 1s. So allowed. No three in a row. Good.\n\nCounts for each row: All rows have 3 zeros and 3 ones. So Rule 3 is satisfied.\n\nCheck for identical rows. Compare each row:\n\nRow1:0 1 0 0 1 1\n\nRow2:0 1 0 1 0 1\n\nRow3:1 0 1 1 0 0\n\nRow4:1 1 0 0 1 0\n\nRow5:0 0 1 1 0 1\n\nRow6:1 0 1 0 1 1\n\nAll rows seem unique. So Rule 4 is satisfied for rows.\n\nNow, columns. Let's check each column.\n\nColumn1:0,0,1,1,0,1\n\nConsecutive: 0,0 at start – allowed. 1,1 next – allowed. 0,1 – no problem. So Rule 2 is okay.\n\nCounts: 0s at 1,2,5 → three. 1s at 3,4,6 → three. Good.\n\nColumn2:1,1,0,1,0,0\n\nConsecutive: 1,1 at start – allowed. Then 0,1,0,0 – no three in a row. Good.\n\nCounts: 0s at 3,5,6 → three. 1s at 1,2,4 → three. Good.\n\nColumn3:0,0,1,0,1,1\n\nConsecutive: 0,0 at start – allowed. Then 1,0,1,1 – two 1s at end. Good.\n\nCounts: 0s at 1,2,4 → three. 1s at 3,5,6 → three. Good.\n\nColumn4:0,1,1,0,1,0\n\nConsecutive: 1,1 at positions 2-3 – allowed. Then 0,1,0. No three in a row. Good.\n\nCounts: 0s at 1,4,6 → three. 1s at 2,3,5 → three. Good.\n\nColumn5:1,0,0,1,0,1\n\nConsecutive: 0,0 at positions 2-3 – allowed. Then 1,0,1. No three in a row. Good.\n\nCounts: 0s at 2,3,5 → three. 1s at 1,4,6 → three. Good.\n\nColumn6:1,1,0,0,1,1\n\nConsecutive: 1,1 at start – allowed. 0,0 next – allowed. Then 1,1 at end – allowed. Wait, but the last two are 1,1. So the entire column is 1,1,0,0,1,1. So consecutive duplicates are only two in a row, which is allowed. So Rule 2 is satisfied.\n\nCounts: 0s at 3,4 → only two. Wait, that's a problem. Let me recount.\n\nColumn6 for Option D:\n\nRow1:1\n\nRow2:1\n\nRow3:0\n\nRow4:0\n\nRow5:1\n\nRow6:1\n\nSo 0s are at positions 3 and 4 → two 0s. 1s are at 1,2,5,6 → four 1s. So counts are unequal. That's a violation of Rule 3. Therefore, Option D is invalid.\n\nWait, but earlier when I checked the counts for each row, they were fine, but the columns might not be. So in Column6, we have two 0s and four 1s. So Option D violates Rule 3 in Column6.\n\nTherefore, Option D is invalid.\n\nSo now, reviewing all options:\n\n- Option A: Passed all rules.\n- Option B: Failed due to unequal counts in Column1.\n- Option C: Failed due to four consecutive 1s in Column4.\n- Option D: Failed due to unequal counts in Column6.\n\nThus, the only valid option is Option A.\n</think>\n\nThe correct answer is Option A because it satisfies all the Binairo rules without any violations.\n\n\\boxed{A}", "ground_truth": "A", "prompt": "You need to solve a Binairo puzzle (Size: 6x6).You need to solve a Binairo puzzle.\n\n**Binairo Puzzle Rules:**\n1.
