{"question_id": "sudoku_502", "response": "Okay, I need to figure out which of the options A, B, C, or D is the correct solution to the 9x9 Sudoku puzzle. Let me start by recalling the rules of Sudoku. Each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid must contain the digits 1 through 9 exactly once.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each option one by one and check for any obvious mistakes. If I find any duplicates in a row, column, or subgrid, that option can be eliminated.\n\nStarting with Option A:\n\nI'll check the first row: 3,5,2,8,6,4,9,7,1. All numbers from 1-9, no duplicates. Good.\n\nSecond row: 1,9,4,5,3,7,2,8,6. Also good.\n\nThird row: 6,7,8,1,9,2,4,5,3. No issues here.\n\nFourth row: 9,2,5,3,7,6,1,4,8. Looks okay.\n\nFifth row: 8,3,1,4,5,9,7,6,2. No duplicates.\n\nSixth row: 7,4,6,6,1,8,5,3,9. Wait, I see two 6s here. That's a problem. So Option A is invalid because the sixth row has duplicates.\n\nMoving on to Option B:\n\nFirst row: 3,5,3,8,6,4,9,7,1. I notice two 3s. That's a mistake. So Option B is out.\n\nNext, Option C:\n\nFirst row: 3,5,2,8,6,4,9,7,1. Good.\n\nSecond row: 1,4,4,5,3,7,2,8,6. Two 4s here. Invalid, so Option C is incorrect.\n\nFinally, Option D:\n\nFirst row: 3,5,2,8,6,4,9,7,1. Good.\n\nSecond row: 1,9,4,5,3,7,2,8,6. No issues.\n\nThird row: 6,7,8,1,9,2,4,5,3. Looks fine.\n\nFourth row: 9,2,5,3,7,6,1,4,8. No duplicates.\n\nFifth row: 8,3,1,4,5,9,7,6,2. All good.\n\nSixth row: 7,4,6,2,1,8,5,3,9. No issues here.\n\nSeventh row: 5,1,7,6,2,3,8,9,4. All numbers present once.\n\nEighth row: 4,6,9,7,8,1,3,2,5. Looks okay.\n\nNinth row: 2,8,3,9,4,5,6,1,7. No duplicates.\n\nNow, I should also check the columns and subgrids for each option, but since A, B, and C had obvious row errors, and D didn't, I can focus on D.\n\nLooking at the columns:\n\nColumn 1: 3,1,6,9,8,7,5,4,2. All unique.\n\nColumn 2: 5,9,7,2,3,4,1,6,8. All unique.\n\nColumn 3: 2,4,8,5,1,6,7,9,3. All unique.\n\nColumn 4: 8,5,1,3,4,2,6,7,9. All unique.\n\nColumn 5: 6,3,9,7,5,1,2,8,4. All unique.\n\nColumn 6: 4,7,2,6,9,8,3,1,5. All unique.\n\nColumn 7: 9,2,4,1,7,5,8,3,6. All unique.\n\nColumn 8: 7,8,5,4,6,3,9,2,1. All unique.\n\nColumn 9: 1,6,3,8,2,9,4,5,7. All unique.\n\nNow checking the 3x3 subgrids:\n\nTop-left subgrid:\n3,5,2\n1,9,4\n6,7,8\nAll numbers 1-9, no duplicates.\n\nTop-middle subgrid:\n8,6,4\n5,3,7\n1,9,2\nWait, let me list them properly:\n\nFirst subgrid row 1: 3,5,2; row 2: 1,9,4; row 3: 6,7,8. All numbers 1-9.\n\nSecond subgrid (columns 4-6, rows 1-3):\n8,6,4\n5,3,7\n1,9,2\nWait, let me check each number: 8,6,4,5,3,7,1,9,2. Yes, all unique.\n\nThird subgrid (columns 7-9, rows 1-3):\n9,7,1\n2,8,6\n4,5,3\nWait, numbers are 9,7,1,2,8,6,4,5,3. All present once.\n\nMiddle-left subgrid (rows 4-6, columns 1-3):\n9,2,5\n8,3,1\n7,4,6\nNumbers: 9,2,5,8,3,1,7,4,6. All unique.\n\nMiddle-middle subgrid (rows 4-6, columns 4-6):\n3,7,6\n4,5,9\n2,1,8\nWait, numbers are 3,7,6,4,5,9,2,1,8. All present.\n\nMiddle-right subgrid (rows 4-6, columns 7-9):\n1,4,8\n7,6,2\n5,3,9\nWait, numbers are 1,4,8,7,6,2,5,3,9. All unique.\n\nBottom-left subgrid (rows 7-9, columns 1-3):\n5,1,7\n4,6,9\n2,8,3\nNumbers: 5,1,7,4,6,9,2,8,3. All unique.\n\nBottom-middle subgrid (rows 7-9, columns 4-6):\n6,2,3\n7,8,1\n9,4,5\nNumbers: 6,2,3,7,8,1,9,4,5. All unique.\n\nBottom-right subgrid (rows 7-9, columns 7-9):\n8,9,4\n3,2,5\n6,1,7\nWait, numbers are 8,9,4,3,2,5,6,1,7. All present once.\n\nSince all rows, columns, and subgrids in Option D are valid, and the other options had clear mistakes, Option D must be the correct solution.\n</think>\n\nThe correct answer is Option D, as it satisfies all Sudoku rules with no duplicates in rows, columns, or subgrids.\n\n\\boxed{D}", "ground_truth": "D", "prompt": "You need to solve a 9x9 Sudoku puzzle.\nYou need to solve a Sudoku puzzle of size 9x9.\n\n**Sudoku Puzzle Rules (9x9 grid):**\n1.  **The Grid:** The grid is a 9x9 square, further divided into each 3x3 subgrid (non-overlapping regions).\n2.  **The Goal:** Fill all empty cells in the grid with digits from 1 to 9.\n3.  **Constraints:** Each digit (1 to 9) must appear exactly once in:\n    a.

{"question_id": "binairo_1260", "response": "Okay, I need to solve this Binairo puzzle and choose the correct option among A, B, C, or D. Let me go through each rule step by step to eliminate the wrong options and find the right one.\n\nFirst, I remember the rules of Binairo:\n\n1. Each cell must be 0 or 1.\n2. No more than two consecutive identical numbers in any row or column.\n3. Each row and column must have an equal number of 0s and 1s. Since it's a 6x6 grid, each row and column should have exactly 3 zeros and 3 ones.\n4. No two rows or columns can be identical.\n\nNow, I'll check each option one by one.\n\nStarting with Option A:\n\nOption A's grid is:\n1 0 0 1 1 0\n0 1 0 1 1 0\n0 1 1 0 0 1\n1 0 1 0 1 0\n0 1 0 1 0 1\n1 0 1 0 0 1\n\nLet me check the rows first. Each row should have exactly 3 ones and 3 zeros. Looking at the first row: 1,0,0,1,1,0. That's 4 ones and 2 zeros. So this row violates rule 3. Therefore, Option A is invalid.\n\nMoving on to Option B:\n\nOption B's grid is:\n0 0 0 1 1 0\n0 1 0 1 1 0\n0 1 1 0 0 1\n1 0 1 0 1 0\n0 1 0 1 0 1\n1 0 1 0 0 1\n\nLooking at the first row: 0,0,0,1,1,0. That's three zeros in a row, which violates rule 2. So Option B is invalid.\n\nNext, Option C:\n\nOption C's grid is:\n1 0 0 1 1 0\n0 1 0 1 1 0\n0 1 1 0 0 1\n1 0 1 1 1 0\n0 1 0 1 0 1\n1 0 1 0 0 1\n\nLet me check each row. First row: 1,0,0,1,1,0. Count of ones is 4, which is incorrect. So Option C is invalid as well.\n\nFinally, Option D:\n\nOption D's grid is:\n1 0 0 1 1 0\n0 1 0 1 1 0\n0 1 1 0 0 1\n1 0 1 0 1 0\n0 1 0 1 0 1\n1 0 1 0 0 0\n\nChecking the rows:\n\nRow 1: 1,0,0,1,1,0 → 4 ones, which is invalid. Wait, that's the same as Option A. But wait, maybe I'm miscounting. Let me recount:\n\nRow 1: 1,0,0,1,1,0 → 1, then 0,0,1,1,0. So ones are at positions 1,4,5. That's three ones. Oh, I must have miscounted earlier. So row 1 has 3 ones and 3 zeros. Good.\n\nRow 2: 0,1,0,1,1,0 → ones at positions 2,4,5. That's three ones. Good.\n\nRow 3: 0,1,1,0,0,1 → ones at 2,3,6. Three ones.\n\nRow 4: 1,0,1,0,1,0 → ones at 1,3,5. Three ones.\n\nRow 5: 0,1,0,1,0,1 → ones at 2,4,6. Three ones.\n\nRow 6: 1,0,1,0,0,0 → ones at 1,3. Only two ones. Wait, that's a problem. So row 6 has two ones and four zeros, which violates rule 3. Therefore, Option D is invalid.\n\nWait, but all the other options are invalid except maybe I made a mistake with Option D. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the last row of Option D. Let me look again:\n\nOption D's last row is: 1,0,1,0,0,0. So positions 1,3 have ones. That's two ones. So yes, it's invalid.\n\nHmm, that's confusing because all options seem invalid, but the problem states that there must be a correct answer. Maybe I made a mistake in checking.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check columns as well for rule 3 and rule 4.\n\nLet me re-examine Option D.\n\nOption D's grid:\n\nRow 1: 1 0 0 1 1 0 → 3 ones\nRow 2: 0 1 0 1 1 0 → 3 ones\nRow 3: 0 1 1 0 0 1 → 3 ones\nRow 4: 1 0 1 0 1 0 → 3 ones\nRow 5: 0 1 0 1 0 1 → 3 ones\nRow 6: 1 0 1 0 0 0 → 2 ones (invalid)\n\nSo row 6 is invalid, so Option D is out.\n\nWait, but all options have at least one row invalid. That can't be right. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, let me check Option C again.\n\nOption C's grid:\n\nRow 1: 1 0 0 1 1 0 → 4 ones (invalid)\nRow 2: 0 1 0 1 1 0 → 3 ones\nRow 3: 0 1 1 0 0 1 → 3 ones\nRow 4: 1 0 1 1 1 0 → 4 ones (invalid)\nRow 5: 0 1 0 1 0 1 → 3 ones\nRow 6: 1 0 1 0 0 1 → 3 ones\n\nSo rows 1 and 4 in Option C are invalid.\n\nOption B's grid:\n\nRow 1: 0 0 0 1 1 0 → 3 zeros (invalid)\nRow 2: 0 1 0 1 1 0 → 3 ones\nRow 3: 0 1 1 0 0 1 → 3 ones\nRow 4: 1 0 1 0 1 0 → 3 ones\nRow 5: 0 1 0 1 0 1 → 3 ones\nRow 6: 1 0 1 0 0 1 → 3 ones\n\nSo only row 1 in Option B is invalid.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in Option D. Let me check the last row again: 1,0,1,0,0,0. That's two ones. So invalid.\n\nBut the problem says there's a correct answer, so perhaps I missed something. Maybe I should check for columns as well.\n\nLet me check Option D's columns:\n\nColumn 1: 1,0,0,1,0,1 → ones at 1,4,6 → 3 ones. Good.\nColumn 2: 0,1,1,0,1,0 → ones at 2,3,5 → 3 ones. Good.\nColumn 3: 0,0,1,1,0,1 → ones at 3,4,6 → 3 ones. Good.\nColumn 4: 1,1,0,0,1,0 → ones at 1,2,5 → 3 ones. Good.\nColumn 5: 1,1,0,1,0,0 → ones at 1,2,4 → 3 ones. Good.\nColumn 6: 0,0,1,0,1,0 → ones at 3,5 → only 2 ones. So column 6 is invalid. Therefore, Option D is invalid.\n\nWait, but all options are invalid? That can't be. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check Option C again. Let me see if any rows have exactly 3 ones.\n\nOption C's grid:\n\nRow 1: 1,0,0,1,1,0 → 4 ones (invalid)\nRow 2: 0,1,0,1,1,0 → 3 ones\nRow 3: 0,1,1,0,0,1 → 3 ones\nRow 4: 1,0,1,1,1,0 → 4 ones (invalid)\nRow 5: 0,1,0,1,0,1 → 3 ones\nRow 6: 1,0,1,0,0,1 → 3 ones\n\nSo rows 1 and 4 are invalid. So Option C is out.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in Option D's last row. Let me recount:\n\nOption D's last row: 1,0,1,0,0,0 → ones at positions 1 and 3 → only 2 ones. So yes, invalid.\n\nWait, maybe I should check if any options have all rows with 3 ones and 3 zeros, and then check other rules.\n\nLet me check Option D again:\n\nRows:\n\n1: 1,0,0,1,1,0 → 3 ones\n2: 0,1,0,1,1,0 → 3 ones\n3: 0,1,1,0,0,1 → 3 ones\n4: 1,0,1,0,1,0 → 3 ones\n5: 0,1,0,1,0,1 → 3 ones\n6: 1,0,1,0,0,0 → 2 ones (invalid)\n\nSo Option D is invalid.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in counting. Let me check Option D's last row again: 1,0,1,0,0,0. So the ones are at 1,3. That's two, so yes, invalid.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check Option A again.\n\nOption A's grid:\n\nRow 1: 1,0,0,1,1,0 → 4 ones (invalid)\nRow 2: 0,1,0,1,1,0 → 3 ones\nRow 3: 0,1,1,0,0,1 → 3 ones\nRow 4: 1,0,1,0,1,0 → 3 ones\nRow 5: 0,1,0,1,0,1 → 3 ones\nRow 6: 1,0,1,0,0,1 → 3 ones\n\nSo only row 1 is invalid in Option A.\n\nWait, but the problem says to choose from the options, so perhaps I'm missing something else. Maybe I should check for rule 2, the consecutive numbers.\n\nLet me check Option D's rows for consecutive numbers.\n\nRow 1: 1,0,0,1,1,0 → 0,0 is two consecutive zeros. That's allowed. Then 1,1 is two consecutive ones, which is allowed. So no problem.\n\nRow 2: 0,1,0,1,1,0 → 1,1 is two consecutive ones, allowed.\n\nRow 3: 0,1,1,0,0,1 → 1,1 and 0,0 are both allowed.\n\nRow 4: 1,0,1,0,1,0 → No consecutive duplicates. Good.\n\nRow 5: 0,1,0,1,0,1 → No consecutive duplicates. Good.\n\nRow 6: 1,0,1,0,0,0 → 0,0,0 at the end. That's three consecutive zeros, which violates rule 2.\n\nAh! So in Option D, row 6 has three consecutive zeros. So that's invalid.\n\nTherefore, Option D is invalid.\n\nWait, but all options have at least one row or column invalid. That can't be right. Maybe I made a mistake in checking.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check columns as well for rule 3.\n\nLet me check Option D's columns:\n\nColumn 1: 1,0,0,1,0,1 → 3 ones. Good.\nColumn 2: 0,1,1,0,1,0 → 3 ones. Good.\nColumn 3: 0,0,1,1,0,1 → 3 ones. Good.\nColumn 4: 1,1,0,0,1,0 → 3 ones. Good.\nColumn 5: 1,1,0,1,0,0 → 3 ones. Good.\nColumn 6: 0,0,1,0,1,0 → 2 ones. Invalid.\n\nSo column 6 in Option D is invalid.\n\nWait, but the problem states that there is a correct answer, so perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe I should check Option C again.\n\nOption C's grid:\n\nRow 1: 1,0,0,1,1,0 → 4 ones (invalid)\nRow 2: 0,1,0,1,1,0 → 3 ones\nRow 3: 0,1,1,0,0,1 → 3 ones\nRow 4: 1,0,1,1,1,0 → 4 ones (invalid)\nRow 5: 0,1,0,1,0,1 → 3 ones\nRow 6: 1,0,1,0,0,1 → 3 ones\n\nSo rows 1 and 4 are invalid.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in Option C's row 4. Let me recount: 1,0,1,1,1,0 → ones at 1,3,4,5 → four ones. Yes, invalid.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Maybe I should look for which option has all rows and columns with 3 ones and no three consecutive same numbers, and all rows and columns are unique.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check Option D again. Maybe I made a mistake in the last row.\n\nOption D's last row: 1,0,1,0,0,0 → ones at 1 and 3, two ones. So invalid.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check if any of the options have all rows and columns with 3 ones, and no three consecutive same numbers.\n\nLooking back, perhaps I should check Option A again.\n\nOption A's grid:\n\nRow 1: 1,0,0,1,1,0 → 4 ones (invalid)\nRow 2: 0,1,0,1,1,0 → 3 ones\nRow 3: 0,1,1,0,0,1 → 3 ones\nRow 4: 1,0,1,0,1,0 → 3 ones\nRow 5: 0,1,0,1,0,1 → 3 ones\nRow 6: 1,0,1,0,0,1 → 3 ones\n\nSo only row 1 is invalid.\n\nWait, maybe I should check if any options have all rows correct except one, but perhaps I'm missing something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should check if any options have all rows with 3 ones and 3 zeros, and columns as well.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check Option D's columns again.\n\nOption D's columns:\n\nColumn 6: 0,0,1,0,1,0 → ones at 3,5 → two ones. So invalid.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm stuck. Since all options seem invalid, but the problem states there's a correct answer, perhaps I made a mistake in checking.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check Option D's rows for consecutive numbers.\n\nRow 6: 1,0,1,0,0,0 → has 0,0,0 at the end, which is three consecutive zeros. So that's invalid.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that maybe I'm miscounting the ones in some rows.\n\nWait, let me check Option D's row 6 again: 1,0,1,0,0,0. So the ones are at positions 1 and 3. That's two ones, so invalid.\n\nHmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should try a different approach. Let me check each option's rows and columns for the number of ones.\n\nOption A:\n\nRows: row 1 has 4 ones → invalid.\n\nOption B:\n\nRow 1 has 3 zeros → invalid.\n\nOption C:\n\nRows 1 and 4 have 4 ones → invalid.\n\nOption D:\n\nRow 6 has 2 ones → invalid.\n\nWait, but the problem says there is a correct answer. Maybe I'm missing something. Perhaps I should check if any option has all rows and columns with 3 ones and 3 zeros, and no three consecutive same numbers, and all rows and columns are unique.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check Option D's rows again. Maybe I made a mistake in counting.\n\nOption D's grid:\n\nRow 1: 1,0,0,1,1,0 → ones at 1,4,5 → 3 ones.\n\nRow 2: 0,1,0,1,1,0 → ones at 2,4,5 → 3 ones.\n\nRow 3: 0,1,1,0,0,1 → ones at 2,3,6 → 3 ones.\n\nRow 4: 1,0,1,0,1,0 → ones at 1,3,5 → 3 ones.\n\nRow 5: 0,1,0,1,0,1 → ones at 2,4,6 → 3 ones.\n\nRow 6: 1,0,1,0,0,0 → ones at 1,3 → 2 ones. So invalid.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check Option D's columns for consecutive numbers.\n\nColumn 6: 0,0,1,0,1,0 → 0,0 at the start is allowed, but then 1,0,1,0 → no three in a row. So column 6 is okay in terms of consecutive numbers, but the count is wrong.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct answer is Option D, but it's invalid. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I should check if any options have all rows with 3 ones, and all columns as well, and then check for consecutive numbers.\n\nOption A:\n\nRow 1 invalid.\n\nOption B:\n\nRow 1 invalid.\n\nOption C:\n\nRows 1 and 4 invalid.\n\nOption D:\n\nRow 6 invalid.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the ones in Option D's row 6. Let me recount:\n\nRow 6: 1,0,1,0,0,0 → 1, then 0,1,0,0,0. So ones at positions 1 and 3 → two ones. So yes, invalid.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct answer is Option D, but it's invalid. That can't be. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should check if any options have all rows and columns correct except for one row or column, but the problem says the answer must be correct, so perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check Option D's columns again for the number of ones.\n\nOption D's columns:\n\nColumn 1: 1,0,0,1,0,1 → ones at 1,4,6 → 3 ones.\n\nColumn 2: 0,1,1,0,1,0 → ones at 2,3,5 → 3 ones.\n\nColumn 3: 0,0,1,1,0,1 → ones at 3,4,6 → 3 ones.\n\nColumn 4: 1,1,0,0,1,0 → ones at 1,2,5 → 3 ones.\n\nColumn 5: 1,1,0,1,0,0 → ones at 1,2,4 → 3 ones.\n\nColumn 6: 0,0,1,0,1,0 → ones at 3,5 → 2 ones. So column 6 is invalid.\n\nTherefore, Option D is invalid.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct answer is Option A, but row 1 has 4 ones. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the ones in Option A's row 1.\n\nOption A's row 1: 1,0,0,1,1,0 → 1, then 0,0,1,1,0. So ones at positions 1,4,5 → 3 ones. Oh! I think I made a mistake earlier. So row 1 in Option A has 3 ones, not 4. Let me recount:\n\n1,0,0,1,1,0 → 1 (1), 0,0,1 (4), 1 (5), 0 (6). So ones at positions 1,4,5 → 3 ones. So row 1 is valid.\n\nWait, I must have miscounted earlier. So Option A's row 1 is valid.\n\nLet me check Option A's grid again:\n\nRow 1: 1,0,0,1,1,0 → 3 ones. Good.\n\nRow 2: 0,1,0,1,1,0 → 3 ones.\n\nRow 3: 0,1,1,0,0,1 → 3 ones.\n\nRow 4: 1,0,1,0,1,0 → 3 ones.\n\nRow 5: 0,1,0,1,0,1 → 3 ones.\n\nRow 6: 1,0,1,0,0,1 → 3 ones.\n\nSo all rows have 3 ones. Good.\n\nNow, check for consecutive numbers in rows.\n\nRow 1: 1,0,0,1,1,0 → 0,0 (allowed) and 1,1 (allowed). Good.\n\nRow 2: 0,1,0,1,1,0 → 1,1 (allowed). Good.\n\nRow 3: 0,1,1,0,0,1 → 1,1 and 0,0 (allowed). Good.\n\nRow 4: 1,0,1,0,1,0 → No consecutive duplicates. Good.\n\nRow 5: 0,1,0,1,0,1 → No consecutive duplicates. Good.\n\nRow 6: 1,0,1,0,0,1 → 0,0 (allowed). Good.\n\nNow, check columns for 3 ones each.\n\nColumn 1: 1,0,0,1,0,1 → ones at 1,4,6 → 3 ones.\n\nColumn 2: 0,1,1,0,1,0 → ones at 2,3,5 → 3 ones.\n\nColumn 3: 0,0,1,1,0,1 → ones at 3,4,6 → 3 ones.\n\nColumn 4: 1,1,0,0,1,0 → ones at 1,2,5 → 3 ones.\n\nColumn 5: 1,1,0,1,0,0 → ones at 1,2,4 → 3 ones.\n\nColumn 6: 0,0,1,0,1,1 → ones at 3,5,6 → 3 ones.\n\nGood, all columns have 3 ones.\n\nNow, check for consecutive numbers in columns.\n\nColumn 1: 1,0,0,1,0,1 → 0,0 (allowed). Good.\n\nColumn 2: 0,1,1,0,1,0 → 1,1 (allowed). Good.\n\nColumn 3: 0,0,1,1,0,1 → 0,0 and 1,1 (allowed). Good.\n\nColumn 4: 1,1,0,0,1,0 → 1,1 and 0,0 (allowed). Good.\n\nColumn 5: 1,1,0,1,0,0 → 1,1 (allowed). Good.\n\nColumn 6: 0,0,1,0,1,1 → 0,0 and 1,1 (allowed). Good.\n\nNow, check rule 4: No two rows or columns are identical.\n\nCheck rows:\n\nRow 1: 1,0,0,1,1,0\n\nRow 2: 0,1,0,1,1,0\n\nRow 3: 0,1,1,0,0,1\n\nRow 4: 1,0,1,0,1,0\n\nRow 5: 0,1,0,1,0,1\n\nRow 6: 1,0,1,0,0,1\n\nAll rows are different.\n\nCheck columns:\n\nColumn 1: 1,0,0,1,0,1\n\nColumn 2: 0,1,1,0,1,0\n\nColumn 3: 0,0,1,1,0,1\n\nColumn 4: 1,1,0,0,1,0\n\nColumn 5: 1,1,0,1,0,0\n\nColumn 6: 0,0,1,0,1,1\n\nAll columns are different.\n\nSo Option A satisfies all the rules. Therefore, the correct answer is Option A.\n</think>\n\nThe correct answer is Option A because it satisfies all the Binairo rules: each row and column has exactly 3 ones and 3 zeros, no more than two consecutive identical numbers, and all rows and columns are unique.\n\n\\boxed{A}", "ground_truth": "A", "prompt": "You need to solve a Binairo puzzle (Size: 6x6).You need to solve a Binairo puzzle.\n\n**Binairo Puzzle Rules:**\n1.
