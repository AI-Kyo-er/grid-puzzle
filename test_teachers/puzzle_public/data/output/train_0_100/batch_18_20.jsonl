{"question_id": "binairo_1396", "response": "Okay, so I need to solve this Binairo puzzle. Let me first make sure I understand the rules correctly. Each cell must be either 0 or 1. No more than two consecutive identical numbers in any row or column, so no three in a row. Each row and column must have an equal number of 0s and 1s. Since it's a 4x4 grid, each row and column must have exactly two 0s and two 1s. Also, no two rows can be identical, and no two columns can be identical either.\n\nLooking at the options provided, A, B, C, D. I need to check each one against these rules.\n\nStarting with Option A:\n\nRow 1: 0 0 1 1\n- Check for consecutive: 0 0 is two, which is allowed. Then 1 1, also two. So that's okay.\n- Each row has two 0s and two 1s. Good.\nRow 2: 1 0 1 0\n- Alternating, so no more than two same in a row. Good.\nRow 3: 1 1 0 0\n- Two 1s, then two 0s. Allowed.\nRow 4: 0 1 0 1\n- Alternating. Good.\n\nNow check columns:\nColumn 1: 0,1,1,0\n- 0,1: no issue. Then 1,1: that's two, which is allowed. Then 1,0: okay. So column 1 has two 1s and two 0s.\nColumn 2: 0,0,1,1\n- 0,0: two, allowed. Then 1,1: two, allowed. So column 2 is okay.\nColumn 3: 1,1,0,0\n- Same as rows, two 1s, then two 0s. Allowed.\nColumn 4: 1,0,0,1\n- 1,0: okay. 0,0: two, allowed. Then 0,1: okay. So column 4 is fine.\n\nNow check if any rows are identical. All rows are different. Row 1: 0011, Row 2: 1010, Row 3: 1100, Row 4: 0101. All unique.\n\nCheck columns for uniqueness:\nColumn 1: 0,1,1,0 → 0110\nColumn 2: 0,0,1,1 → 0011\nColumn 3: 1,1,0,0 → 1100\nColumn 4: 1,0,0,1 → 1001\nAll columns are unique. So Option A seems to satisfy all rules.\n\nBut let me check the other options just to be sure.\n\nOption B:\nRow 1: 1 0 1 1\n- Consecutive 1s at the end: 1 1, which is two. Allowed.\n- Each row has two 0s and two 1s? Let's count: 1,0,1,1 → three 1s and one 0. Oh, that's not equal. So Option B violates rule 3. So B is out.\n\nOption C:\nRow 1: 0 0 1 1 → okay\nRow 2: 1 0 1 0 → okay\nRow 3: 1 1 1 0 → three 1s in a row. That's not allowed. So Option C is invalid.\n\nOption D:\nRow 1: 0 0 1 1 → okay\nRow 2: 1 0 1 0 → okay\nRow 3: 1 1 0 0 → okay\nRow 4: 0 1 0 0 → has two 0s at the end. So two consecutive 0s, allowed. But let's check the count. Row 4 has three 0s and one 1. That violates rule 3. So D is invalid.\n\nSo the only valid option is A.\n</think>\n\nThe correct answer is Option A, as it adheres to all Binairo rules without any violations.\n\n\\boxed{A}", "ground_truth": "A", "prompt": "You need to solve a Binairo puzzle (Size: 4x4).You need to solve a Binairo puzzle.\n\n**Binairo Puzzle Rules:**\n1.

{"question_id": "sudoku_415", "response": "Okay, so I have to solve this Sudoku puzzle by choosing the correct completed grid from options A, B, C, or D. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember the rules: each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid must contain all digits from 1 to 9 exactly once. The given numbers are clues, and I need to fill in the empty cells logically.\n\nLooking at the options, each one is a full 9x9 grid. I need to check each one to see if it adheres to the Sudoku rules. Since I can't solve it step-by-step myself, I'll have to analyze each option for any violations.\n\nStarting with Option A:\n\nI'll check the first row: 9,8,3,5,2,6,7,4,1. That looks good, all numbers from 1-9 without repeats. Let's check the first column: 9,6,1,3,7,8,2,5,4. Also good. Now, the subgrids. The top-left subgrid has 9,8,3; 6,7,2; 1,4,5. All unique. Similarly, I'll check a few others but since it's an option, maybe it's correct, but I need to check others too.\n\nOption B: Let's look at the second row: 1,7,2,4,8,1,5,9,3. Wait, I see two 1s in this row. That's a problem because each row must have unique numbers. So Option B is invalid. I can eliminate B right away.\n\nOption C: Check the same as A. First row looks good. Let me check the fifth row: 7,2,4,6,3,8,1,5,9. That seems fine. Now, looking at the fifth column: 2,8,7,9,3,5,1,4,6. All unique. Hmm, seems okay. Let me check the subgrids. The middle-left subgrid has 3,5,1; 7,2,4; 8,9,6. All unique. Maybe C is correct.\n\nOption D: Let's check the seventh row: 2,3,9,8,1,7,9,6,5. Oh, there are two 9s here. That's a mistake, so D is invalid. So D is out.\n\nNow, between A and C. Let me check more carefully. In Option A, the ninth row is 4,1,8,9,6,5,2,3,7. Let me check the subgrids. The bottom-right subgrid has 2,3,7; 9,1,8; 5,6,4. Wait, 2,3,7,9,1,8,5,6,4 – all unique. Seems okay.\n\nIn Option C, the ninth row is 4,1,8,9,6,5,2,3,7. Same as A, so that's fine. Let me check the sixth row in C: 8,9,6,1,5,4,3,7,2. All unique. Now, let me check the third column in C: 3,2,5,1,4,6,9,7,8. All unique. So both A and C look correct so far, but wait, maybe I missed something.\n\nWait, in Option A, the fifth row is 7,2,4,6,3,8,1,5,3. Wait, two 3s in the fifth row. Oh no, that's a mistake. So Option A is invalid because the fifth row has two 3s. I must have missed that earlier.\n\nSo, Option C is the only one left. Let me double-check Option C. The fifth row is 7,2,4,6,3,8,1,5,9. No repeats. The sixth row: 8,9,6,1,5,4,3,7,2. All unique. The third column: 3,2,5,1,4,6,9,7,8. All unique. The subgrids seem okay too. So Option C must be the correct one.\n</think>\n\nThe correct answer is Option C because it adheres to all Sudoku rules without any duplicates in rows, columns, or subgrids.\n\n\\boxed{C}", "ground_truth": "C", "prompt": "You need to solve a 9x9 Sudoku puzzle.\nYou need to solve a Sudoku puzzle of size 9x9.\n\n**Sudoku Puzzle Rules (9x9 grid):**\n1.  **The Grid:** The grid is a 9x9 square, further divided into each 3x3 subgrid (non-overlapping regions).\n2.  **The Goal:** Fill all empty cells in the grid with digits from 1 to 9.\n3.  **Constraints:** Each digit (1 to 9) must appear exactly once in:\n    a.
