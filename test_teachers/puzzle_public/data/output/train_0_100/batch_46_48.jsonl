{"question_id": "sudoku_73", "response": "Alright, so I need to figure out which of the four options (A, B, C, D) is the correct solution to the 9x9 Sudoku puzzle. Since I'm just starting out with Sudoku, I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Sudoku rules require each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid to contain all digits from 1 to 9 exactly once. So, I'll need to check each option against these rules.\n\nLooking at the options, they all have the first row as 1 7 6 5 4 2 9 8 3. I think that's correct because it contains all numbers from 1 to 9 without repetition. So, the first row is fine in all options.\n\nNow, let's check the second row for each option. Option A's second row is 2 3 9 7 8 1 6 5 4. That looks good—no duplicates, all numbers from 1-9. The same goes for Options B and C. Option D's second row is the same, so no issues there yet.\n\nNext, I'll check the third row. Option A's third row is 4 5 8 5 6 9 1 7 2. Wait a minute, I see two 5s here. That's a problem because each number should appear only once. So, Option A is invalid because of this duplication in the third row.\n\nMoving on to Option B, the third row is 4 5 8 3 6 9 1 7 2. Let's check for duplicates. All numbers are unique and cover 1-9. So, the third row in B is correct.\n\nOption C's third row is also 4 5 8 3 6 9 1 7 2, same as B, so it's correct. Option D's third row is 4 5 8 3 6 9 1 7 2 as well, so no issues there.\n\nNow, let's look at the fourth row. Option A's fourth row is 7 6 4 1 2 3 8 9 5. That seems okay. But wait, I should check if any number repeats in the row. 7,6,4,1,2,3,8,9,5—all unique. So, it's fine.\n\nOption B's fourth row is the same as A's, so no problem. Option C's fourth row is 7 6 4 1 2 3 8 9 5, same as A and B. Option D's fourth row is 7 6 4 9 2 3 8 9 5. Oh, I see two 9s here. That's a mistake because each number should appear once. So, Option D is invalid due to the duplicated 9s in the fourth row.\n\nNow, I'm down to Options B and C. Let's check the fifth row. Option B's fifth row is 9 1 5 4 7 8 2 3 6. All numbers are unique and cover 1-9. Option C's fifth row is 5 1 5 4 7 2 2 3 6. Wait, there are two 5s and two 2s here. That's definitely wrong. So, Option C is out.\n\nThat leaves Option B. Let me check the rest to be sure. The sixth row in B is 8 2 3 9 5 6 4 1 7. All unique numbers. The seventh row is 5 8 1 2 3 4 7 6 9. All good. The eighth row is 6 4 7 8 9 5 3 2 1. Let's check for duplicates: 6,4,7,8,9,5,3,2,1. No repeats, perfect.\n\nFinally, the ninth row in B is 3 9 2 6 1 7 5 4 8. All numbers are unique and cover 1-9. \n\nWait, but I should also check the columns and subgrids. Let me pick a column. Let's take column 1. It goes 1,2,4,7,9,8,5,6,3. All unique, good. Column 2: 7,3,5,6,1,2,8,4,9. All unique. Column 3: 6,9,8,4,5,3,1,7,2. No duplicates.\n\nNow, the subgrids. Let's check the top-left 3x3 subgrid. It's rows 1-3, columns 1-3. Numbers are 1,7,6; 2,3,9; 4,5,8. All numbers from 1-9 without repetition. Good.\n\nNext, the top-middle subgrid (rows 1-3, columns 4-6). Numbers are 5,4,2;7,8,1;5,6,9. Wait, hold on. In row 3, column 4, it's 3. So, 5,4,2;7,8,1;3,6,9. Wait, no, actually, looking at Option B's grid, the third row, columns 4-6 are 3,6,9. So, the subgrid numbers are 5,4,2;7,8,1;3,6,9. All unique, correct.\n\nI think I can safely say that Option B is the correct solution as it passes all the checks without any duplicates in rows, columns, or subgrids.\n</think>\n\nThe correct answer is Option B, as it adheres to all Sudoku rules without any duplicates in rows, columns, or subgrids.\n\n\\boxed{B}", "ground_truth": "B", "prompt": "You need to solve a 9x9 Sudoku puzzle.\nYou need to solve a Sudoku puzzle of size 9x9.\n\n**Sudoku Puzzle Rules (9x9 grid):**\n1.  **The Grid:** The grid is a 9x9 square, further divided into each 3x3 subgrid (non-overlapping regions).\n2.  **The Goal:** Fill all empty cells in the grid with digits from 1 to 9.\n3.  **Constraints:** Each digit (1 to 9) must appear exactly once in:\n    a.

{"question_id": "binairo_1458", "response": "Okay, so I need to solve this Binairo puzzle. Let me first make sure I understand the rules correctly. \n\nEach cell must be either 0 or 1. No more than two consecutive identical numbers in any row or column. Each row and column must have an equal number of 0s and 1s, so in a 4x4 grid, each row and column must have exactly two 0s and two 1s. Also, no two rows can be identical, and no two columns can be identical either.\n\nThe options given are A, B, C, D. I need to check each one to see which one satisfies all the rules.\n\nLet me start by looking at each option one by one.\n\nOption A:\n0 1 0 1\n0 0 1 1\n1 1 0 0\n1 0 1 0\n\nFirst, check the rows for consecutive numbers.\n\nRow 1: 0 1 0 1 – no three in a row. Good.\n\nRow 2: 0 0 1 1 – two 0s, then two 1s. That's acceptable because it's exactly two consecutive.\n\nRow 3: 1 1 0 0 – same as row 2. Two 1s, then two 0s. Okay.\n\nRow 4: 1 0 1 0 – alternates, so no problem.\n\nNow, check columns.\n\nColumn 1: 0, 0, 1, 1 – two 0s followed by two 1s. That's allowed.\n\nColumn 2: 1, 0, 1, 0 – alternates, no issue.\n\nColumn 3: 0, 1, 0, 1 – alternates.\n\nColumn 4: 1, 1, 0, 0 – two 1s then two 0s. Allowed.\n\nNext, check if each row has two 0s and two 1s.\n\nRow 1: 0,1,0,1 – two 0s, two 1s. Good.\n\nRow 2: 0,0,1,1 – same, two each.\n\nRow 3: 1,1,0,0 – same.\n\nRow 4: 1,0,1,0 – same.\n\nColumns:\n\nColumn 1: 0,0,1,1 – two each.\n\nColumn 2: 1,0,1,0 – two each.\n\nColumn 3: 0,1,0,1 – two each.\n\nColumn 4: 1,1,0,0 – two each.\n\nNow, check uniqueness of rows and columns.\n\nRows:\n\nRow 1: 0101\n\nRow 2: 0011\n\nRow 3: 1100\n\nRow 4: 1010\n\nAre any of these rows identical? Let's see:\n\n0101, 0011, 1100, 1010 – all different. So rows are unique.\n\nColumns:\n\nColumn 1: 0,0,1,1\n\nColumn 2: 1,0,1,0\n\nColumn 3: 0,1,0,1\n\nColumn 4: 1,1,0,0\n\nAre any columns identical?

So columns are unique.\n\nSo Option A seems to satisfy all the rules. But let me check the other options to make sure.\n\nOption B:\n1 1 0 1\n0 0 1 1\n1 1 0 0\n1 0 1 0\n\nFirst, check rows for consecutive numbers.\n\nRow 1: 1,1,0,1 – two 1s at the start. That's allowed. Then 0,1 – no issues.\n\nRow 2: 0,0,1,1 – same as before, allowed.\n\nRow 3: 1,1,0,0 – allowed.\n\nRow 4: 1,0,1,0 – alternates.\n\nNow check columns.\n\nColumn 1: 1,0,1,1 – three 1s in a row? Wait, the first three cells are 1,0,1 – no, but the last cell is 1. So 1,0,1,1 – that has two 1s at the end, but the sequence is 1,0,1,1. The last two are 1s, so two in a row, which is allowed. But wait, the first and third are 1s with a 0 in between, so no consecutive three.\n\nWait, but the rule is no more than two consecutive. So two is okay.\n\nColumn 2: 1,0,1,0 – alternates.\n\nColumn 3: 0,1,0,0 – two 0s at the end. Allowed.\n\nColumn 4: 1,1,0,0 – two 1s, then two 0s. Allowed.\n\nNow, check each row for two 0s and 1s.\n\nRow 1: 1,1,0,1 – three 1s. That's a problem because in a 4-cell row, we can only have two 1s and two 0s. So Row 1 has three 1s, which violates the rule. Therefore, Option B is invalid.\n\nSo I can eliminate Option B.\n\nOption C:\n0 1 0 1\n0 0 1 1\n1 1 1 0\n1 0 1 0\n\nCheck rows first.\n\nRow 1: 0,1,0,1 – okay.\n\nRow 2: 0,0,1,1 – okay.\n\nRow 3: 1,1,1,0 – three 1s in a row. That's not allowed. So Option C is invalid.\n\nOption D:\n0 1 0 1\n0 0 1 1\n1 1 0 0\n1 0 1 1\n\nCheck rows.\n\nRow 1: 0,1,0,1 – okay.\n\nRow 2: 0,0,1,1 – okay.\n\nRow 3: 1,1,0,0 – okay.\n\nRow 4: 1,0,1,1 – ends with two 1s. That's allowed.\n\nNow, check columns.\n\nColumn 1: 0,0,1,1 – okay.\n\nColumn 2: 1,0,1,0 – alternates.\n\nColumn 3: 0,1,0,1 – alternates.\n\nColumn 4: 1,1,0,1 – ends with two 1s. Wait, but the last two cells are 0 and 1. Wait, Column 4: first cell is 1, second is 1, third is 0, fourth is 1. So 1,1,0,1 – that's two 1s at the top, which is allowed, but then 0 and 1. No three in a row.\n\nWait, but let's check if each row and column has exactly two 0s and two 1s.\n\nRow 4: 1,0,1,1 – has three 1s. That's a problem. Because in a 4-cell row, we need exactly two 0s and two 1s. So Row 4 in Option D has three 1s and one 0. So that's invalid. Therefore, Option D is out.\n\nSo the only valid option is Option A.\n</think>\n\nThe correct answer is Option A because it adheres to all Binairo rules without any violations.\n\n\\boxed{A}", "ground_truth": "A", "prompt": "You need to solve a Binairo puzzle (Size: 4x4).You need to solve a Binairo puzzle.\n\n**Binairo Puzzle Rules:**\n1.
