{"question_id": "binairo_119", "response": "Alright, let's tackle this Binairo puzzle step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll need to carefully go through each rule and see how they apply to the options given.\n\nFirst, I'll recall the rules:\n\n1. Each cell must be 0 or 1.\n2. No more than two consecutive identical numbers in any row or column.\n3. Each row and column must have an equal number of 0s and 1s.\n4. No two rows or columns can be identical.\n\nLooking at the options, I'll check each one against these rules.\n\nStarting with Option A:\n```\n0 1 0 1\n1 1 0 0\n0 0 1 1\n1 0 1 0\n```\n\nLet me check each row for rule 2. The first row is 0 1 0 1. No consecutive duplicates, good. Second row: 1 1 0 0. There's two 1s in a row, which is allowed, and two 0s, also allowed. Third row: 0 0 1 1. Again, two of each, okay. Fourth row: 1 0 1 0. No consecutive duplicates, so that's fine.\n\nNow, rule 3: each row must have two 0s and two 1s. Let's count.\n\nRow 1: two 0s and two 1s. Good.\nRow 2: two 1s and two 0s. Wait, no, looking again: 1,1,0,0. So two 1s and two 0s. Okay.\nRow 3: same as row 2. Two 0s and two 1s. Wait, no: 0,0,1,1. So two 0s and two 1s. Okay.\nRow 4: two 1s and two 0s. Yes.\n\nNow, rule 4: no identical rows. Looking at rows:\n\nRow 1: 0 1 0 1\nRow 2: 1 1 0 0\nRow 3: 0 0 1 1\nRow 4: 1 0 1 0\n\nAll rows are different. Good.\n\nNow columns. Each column must also have two 0s and two 1s, and no identical columns.\n\nLet's check columns:\n\nColumn 1: 0,1,0,1. So two 0s and two 1s. And it's unique because the other columns are different.\n\nColumn 2: 1,1,0,0. Two 1s and two 0s. Also unique.\n\nColumn 3: 0,0,1,1. Two 0s and two 1s. Unique.\n\nColumn 4: 1,0,1,0. Two 1s and two 0s. Unique.\n\nSo Option A seems to satisfy all the rules. But I should check the other options to make sure.\n\nOption B:\n```\n1 1 0 1\n1 1 0 0\n0 0 1 1\n1 0 1 0\n```\n\nFirst, check rows for consecutive duplicates.\n\nRow 1: 1 1 0 1. Two 1s at the start, which is allowed. Then 0, then 1. So okay.\n\nRow 2: 1 1 0 0. Two 1s and two 0s. Allowed.\n\nRow 3: 0 0 1 1. Allowed.\n\nRow 4: 1 0 1 0. No consecutive duplicates. Good.\n\nNow, check row counts:\n\nRow 1: three 1s? Wait, let's count. 1,1,0,1: that's three 1s and one 0. Oh, that's a problem because each row must have exactly two 0s and two 1s. So Option B fails rule 3.\n\nSo B is out.\n\nOption C:\n```\n0 1 0 1\n1 1 0 0\n0 0 0 1\n1 0 1 0\n```\n\nCheck rows first.\n\nRow 1: 0 1 0 1. Good, no consecutive duplicates, two 0s and two 1s.\n\nRow 2: 1 1 0 0. Allowed.\n\nRow 3: 0 0 0 1. Oh no, three 0s in a row. That violates rule 2, which says no more than two consecutive identical numbers. So Option C is invalid.\n\nOption D:\n```\n0 1 0 1\n1 1 0 0\n0 0 1 1\n1 0 1 1\n```\n\nCheck rows.\n\nRow 1: good.\n\nRow 2: good.\n\nRow 3: good.\n\nRow 4: 1 0 1 1. Ends with two 1s. That's allowed, but let's check counts.\n\nRow 4: three 1s and one 0. So that's three 1s, which violates rule 3. So D is out.\n\nSo the only option that satisfies all rules is Option A.\n</think>\n\nThe correct answer is Option A because it adheres to all the given rules without any violations.\n\n\\boxed{A}", "ground_truth": "A", "prompt": "You need to solve a Binairo puzzle (Size: 4x4).You need to solve a Binairo puzzle.\n\n**Binairo Puzzle Rules:**\n1.

{"question_id": "sudoku_144", "response": "Okay, so I need to solve this 9x9 Sudoku puzzle by choosing the correct option among A, B, C, and D. Let me go through each option step by step to check which one adheres to the Sudoku rules.\n\nFirst, I remember that Sudoku requires each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid to contain all digits from 1 to 9 without repetition. I'll start by examining each option for any obvious mistakes.\n\nStarting with Option A:\nLooking at row 7: 9 6 2 7 5 3 8 4 8. Wait, I see the digit 8 appears twice in this row. That's a mistake because each digit must appear only once. So Option A is invalid.\n\nMoving on to Option B:\nI'll check each row and column. Looking at row 2: 5 5 6 9 7 2 1 8 3. Oh, there are two 5s here. That's another mistake. So Option B is also incorrect.\n\nNext, Option C:\nI'll go through each row. Row 2: 5 4 6 9 7 2 1 8 3 – looks good. Row 7: 9 6 2 7 5 3 8 4 1 – seems okay. Now, checking the columns and subgrids. Let me check column 9. The digits are 7,3,4,8,5,9,1,2,6. All unique. Now, the subgrids: the top-left 3x3 has 8,1,3; 5,4,6; 2,7,9. All digits from 1-9 without repeats. The middle subgrid and others seem fine as well. I don't spot any duplicates here.\n\nFinally, Option D:\nLooking at row 7: 9 6 2 7 5 3 7 4 1. Oh, the digit 7 appears twice here. That's another error. So Option D is out.\n\nAfter eliminating Options A, B, and D due to duplicates, Option C is the only one left that follows all Sudoku rules correctly. I'll confirm once more by checking a few more rows and columns in C to ensure no mistakes. Everything seems in order, so Option C must be the correct solution.\n</think>\n\nAfter analyzing each option, Option C is the only one that adheres to all Sudoku rules without any duplicates in rows, columns, or subgrids.\n\n\\boxed{C}", "ground_truth": "C", "prompt": "You need to solve a 9x9 Sudoku puzzle.\nYou need to solve a Sudoku puzzle of size 9x9.\n\n**Sudoku Puzzle Rules (9x9 grid):**\n1.  **The Grid:** The grid is a 9x9 square, further divided into each 3x3 subgrid (non-overlapping regions).\n2.  **The Goal:** Fill all empty cells in the grid with digits from 1 to 9.\n3.  **Constraints:** Each digit (1 to 9) must appear exactly once in:\n    a.
