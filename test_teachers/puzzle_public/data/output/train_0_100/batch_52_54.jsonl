{"question_id": "binairo_1197", "response": "Okay, so I need to solve this Binairo puzzle and choose the correct option from A, B, C, or D. Let me go through each rule step by step and check each option accordingly.\n\nFirst, I'll recall the rules:\n\n1. Each cell must be 0 or 1.\n2. No more than two consecutive identical numbers in any row or column.\n3. Each row and column must have an equal number of 0s and 1s. Since it's a 6x6 grid, each row and column should have exactly 3 zeros and 3 ones.\n4. No two rows or columns can be identical.\n\nNow, I'll check each option one by one.\n\nStarting with Option A:\n\nOption A's grid is:\n0 0 1 1 0 1\n0 1 0 0 1 1\n1 0 1 0 1 0\n0 1 0 1 0 1\n1 1 0 0 1 0\n1 0 1 1 0 0\n\nLet me check each row for consecutive numbers and count of 0s and 1s.\n\nRow 1: 0,0,1,1,0,1\n- Consecutive 0s: two at the start, which is allowed. Consecutive 1s: two in the middle, also allowed. So rule 2 is satisfied.\n- Count: 0s: 3, 1s: 3. Good.\n\nRow 2: 0,1,0,0,1,1\n- Consecutive 0s: two in positions 3-4. Allowed.\n- 1s: two at the end. Allowed.\n- Count: 0s: 3, 1s: 3. Good.\n\nRow 3: 1,0,1,0,1,0\n- No consecutive duplicates. Good.\n- Count: 3 zeros, 3 ones.\n\nRow 4: 0,1,0,1,0,1\n- Same as row 3. No consecutive duplicates.\n- Count: 3,3.\n\nRow 5: 1,1,0,0,1,0\n- Two 1s at start, two 0s next. Allowed.\n- Count: 3 zeros, 3 ones.\n\nRow 6: 1,0,1,1,0,0\n- Two 1s in positions 3-4. Allowed.\n- Two 0s at the end. Allowed.\n- Count: 3 zeros, 3 ones.\n\nSo all rows satisfy rules 2 and 3. Now, check columns.\n\nColumn 1:\n0,0,1,0,1,1\n- Looking for consecutive duplicates. 0,0 at top, which is allowed. Then 1,0,1,1. The last two 1s are consecutive. Wait, let's see the exact sequence: 0,0,1,0,1,1.\n- The last two cells are 1,1. So that's two consecutive 1s. Is that allowed? Yes, because rule 2 allows up to two. So no issue here.\n\nColumn 2:\n0,1,0,1,0,0\n- Let's check for consecutive duplicates. 0,1,0,1,0,0. The last two 0s are consecutive. So that's allowed.\n\nColumn 3:\n1,0,1,0,0,1\n- 1,0,1,0,0,1. The last two 0s are consecutive. Allowed.\n\nColumn 4:\n1,0,0,1,0,1\n- 1,0,0,1,0,1. The two 0s in positions 2-3. Allowed.\n\nColumn 5:\n0,1,1,0,1,0\n- 0,1,1,0,1,0. The two 1s are consecutive. Allowed.\n\nColumn 6:\n1,1,0,1,0,0\n- 1,1 at start: allowed. Then 0,1,0,0. Two 0s at the end: allowed.\n\nSo all columns satisfy rule 2.\n\nNow, check if any rows are identical. Looking at the rows:\n\nRow 1: 0,0,1,1,0,1\nRow 2: 0,1,0,0,1,1\nRow 3: 1,0,1,0,1,0\nRow 4: 0,1,0,1,0,1\nRow 5: 1,1,0,0,1,0\nRow 6: 1,0,1,1,0,0\n\nAll rows are unique. Now columns: Let's list each column as a string.\n\nColumn 1: 0,0,1,0,1,1 → 001011\nColumn 2: 0,1,0,1,0,0 → 010100\nColumn 3: 1,0,1,0,0,1 → 101001\nColumn 4: 1,0,0,1,0,1 → 100101\nColumn 5: 0,1,1,0,1,0 → 011010\nColumn 6: 1,1,0,1,0,0 → 110100\n\nAll columns are unique. So Option A seems to satisfy all rules.\n\nBut let me check other options just to be thorough.\n\nOption B:\n\n1 0 1 1 0 1\n0 1 0 0 1 1\n1 0 1 0 1 0\n0 1 0 1 0 1\n1 1 0 0 1 0\n1 0 1 1 0 0\n\nCheck rows:\n\nRow 1: 1,0,1,1,0,1\n- Consecutive 1s: two at positions 3-4. Allowed.\n- Count: 3 ones, 3 zeros.\n\nRow 2: 0,1,0,0,1,1\n- Consecutive 0s: two in positions 3-4. Allowed.\n- Count: 3,3.\n\nRow 3: 1,0,1,0,1,0\n- No consecutive duplicates.\n- Count: 3,3.\n\nRow 4: 0,1,0,1,0,1\n- No consecutive duplicates.\n- Count: 3,3.\n\nRow 5: 1,1,0,0,1,0\n- Two 1s, two 0s. Allowed.\n- Count: 3,3.\n\nRow 6: 1,0,1,1,0,0\n- Two 1s in positions 3-4. Allowed.\n- Two 0s at end. Allowed.\n- Count: 3,3.\n\nRows seem okay. Now columns:\n\nColumn 1:\n1,0,1,0,1,1 → 1,0,1,0,1,1\n- Consecutive 1s at the end: allowed.\n\nColumn 2:\n0,1,0,1,0,0 → 0,1,0,1,0,0\n- Two 0s at the end: allowed.\n\nColumn 3:\n1,0,1,0,0,1 → 1,0,1,0,0,1\n- Two 0s at positions 5-6: allowed.\n\nColumn 4:\n1,0,0,1,0,1 → 1,0,0,1,0,1\n- Two 0s in positions 2-3: allowed.\n\nColumn 5:\n0,1,1,0,1,0 → 0,1,1,0,1,0\n- Two 1s in positions 2-3: allowed.\n\nColumn 6:\n1,1,0,1,0,0 → 1,1,0,1,0,0\n- Two 1s at start: allowed.\n\nNow, check uniqueness of rows and columns.\n\nRows: Row 1 is 1,0,1,1,0,1; others look unique.\n\nColumns:\n\nColumn 1: 101011\nColumn 2: 010100\nColumn 3: 101001\nColumn 4: 100101\nColumn 5: 011010\nColumn 6: 110100\n\nAll unique. So Option B also satisfies all rules. Hmm, that's conflicting because I thought A was correct, but B also seems valid.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check again.\n\nLooking back at the problem, it's a 6x6 grid, so each row and column must have exactly 3 zeros and 3 ones. Let me recount for Option B.\n\nRow 1: 1,0,1,1,0,1 → 1s: 4? Wait, 1,0,1,1,0,1. That's 4 ones and 2 zeros. Oh no! That violates rule 3 because it's not equal. So Option B is invalid. I must have miscounted earlier.\n\nYes, in row 1 of Option B: 1,0,1,1,0,1. Let's count 1s: positions 1,3,4,6 → four 1s. So that's invalid. Therefore, Option B is incorrect. I must have overlooked that earlier.\n\nNow moving to Option C:\n\nOption C's grid is:\n0 0 1 1 0 1\n0 1 0 0 1 1\n1 0 1 0 1 0\n0 1 0 0 0 1\n1 1 0 0 1 0\n1 0 1 1 0 0\n\nCheck rows:\n\nRow 1: 0,0,1,1,0,1 → 3 zeros, 3 ones. Consecutive 0s and 1s allowed.\n\nRow 2: 0,1,0,0,1,1 → 3 zeros, 3 ones. Consecutive 0s in positions 3-4.\n\nRow 3: 1,0,1,0,1,0 → 3 zeros, 3 ones. No consecutive duplicates.\n\nRow 4: 0,1,0,0,0,1 → 0s: 4, 1s: 2. Oh no, that's invalid because it doesn't have equal numbers. So Option C is out.\n\nOption D:\n\n0 0 1 1 0 1\n0 1 0 0 1 1\n1 0 1 0 1 0\n0 1 0 1 0 1\n1 1 0 0 1 0\n1 0 1 1 0 1\n\nCheck rows:\n\nRow 1: 0,0,1,1,0,1 → 3 zeros, 3 ones.\n\nRow 2: 0,1,0,0,1,1 → 3 zeros, 3 ones.\n\nRow 3: 1,0,1,0,1,0 → 3 zeros, 3 ones.\n\nRow 4: 0,1,0,1,0,1 → 3 zeros, 3 ones.\n\nRow 5: 1,1,0,0,1,0 → 3 ones, 3 zeros. Consecutive 1s and 0s.\n\nRow 6: 1,0,1,1,0,1 → 1s: positions 1,3,4,6 → four 1s. That's invalid because it has unequal count. So Option D is incorrect.\n\nSo now, only Option A and Option B were considered, but B has a row with four 1s, which makes it invalid. So the only valid option is A.\n\nWait, let me confirm Option A's rows and columns again for any possible issues.\n\nLooking back at Option A's rows:\n\nRow 1: 0,0,1,1,0,1 → 3,3.\n\nRow 2: 0,1,0,0,1,1 → 3,3.\n\nRow 3: 1,0,1,0,1,0 → 3,3.\n\nRow 4: 0,1,0,1,0,1 → 3,3.\n\nRow 5: 1,1,0,0,1,0 → 3,3.\n\nRow 6: 1,0,1,1,0,0 → 3,3.\n\nAll rows have equal counts. Columns:\n\nColumn 1: 0,0,1,0,1,1 → 3 zeros, 3 ones.\n\nColumn 2: 0,1,0,1,0,0 → 3 zeros, 3 ones.\n\nColumn 3: 1,0,1,0,0,1 → 3 zeros, 3 ones.\n\nColumn 4: 1,0,0,1,0,1 → 3 zeros, 3 ones.\n\nColumn 5: 0,1,1,0,1,0 → 3 zeros, 3 ones.\n\nColumn 6: 1,1,0,1,0,0 → 3 zeros, 3 ones.\n\nAll columns are okay.\n\nNow, check for identical rows or columns in Option A.\n\nRows:\n\n1: 0,0,1,1,0,1\n2: 0,1,0,0,1,1\n3: 1,0,1,0,1,0\n4: 0,1,0,1,0,1\n5: 1,1,0,0,1,0\n6: 1,0,1,1,0,0\n\nAll unique.\n\nColumns:\n\nColumn 1: 001011\nColumn 2: 010100\nColumn 3: 101001\nColumn 4: 100101\nColumn 5: 011010\nColumn 6: 110100\n\nAll unique. So Option A is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe correct answer is Option A, as it satisfies all the rules of the Binairo puzzle without any violations.\n\n\\boxed{A}", "ground_truth": "A", "prompt": "You need to solve a Binairo puzzle (Size: 6x6).You need to solve a Binairo puzzle.\n\n**Binairo Puzzle Rules:**\n1.

{"question_id": "sudoku_655", "response": "Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Sudoku puzzle, and I have four options to choose from: A, B, C, and D. I need to figure out which one is the correct completed grid. Let me go through each option step by step and check if they follow the Sudoku rules.\n\nFirst, I remember that Sudoku rules require each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid to contain all digits from 1 to 9 without repetition. So, I need to check each option against these rules.\n\nLet's start with Option A. I'll go through each row, column, and subgrid.\n\nLooking at Option A:\n- The first row is 3,4,9,1,8,5,7,6,2. That looks okay, all numbers from 1-9 without repetition.\n- Second row: 1,5,7,6,3,9,4,9,8. Wait, I see two 9s here. That's a problem because each number should appear only once. So, Option A is invalid right there.\n\nMoving on to Option B:\n- First row: 3,4,9,1,8,5,7,6,2. Looks good.\n- Second row: 1,5,7,6,3,2,4,9,8. Check for duplicates. Hmm, I don't see any duplicates here. Let me check the numbers: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. All present once. Good so far.\n- Let me check the third row: 2,6,8,7,4,9,1,5,3. Again, all numbers are unique.\n- Fourth row: 4,7,1,2,5,6,3,8,9. No duplicates here.\n- Fifth row: 8,3,5,9,7,4,6,2,1. All good.\n- Sixth row: 9,2,6,3,1,8,5,7,4. Looks fine.\n- Seventh row: 7,1,2,8,6,3,9,4,5. No issues.\n- Eighth row: 6,8,4,5,9,1,2,3,7. All numbers present once.\n- Ninth row: 5,9,3,4,2,7,8,1,6. Good.\n\nNow, I need to check the columns. Let's take the first column of Option B:\n3,1,2,4,8,9,7,6,5. All unique, no duplicates.\n\nSecond column: 4,5,6,7,3,2,1,8,9. All unique.\n\nThird column: 9,7,8,1,5,6,2,4,3. All good.\n\nFourth column: 1,6,7,2,9,3,8,5,4. No duplicates.\n\nFifth column: 8,3,4,5,7,1,6,9,2. All numbers once.\n\nSixth column:5,9,9,6,4,8,3,1,7. Wait, here I see two 9s in the sixth column. That's a problem. So Option B is invalid because the sixth column has duplicates.\n\nMoving on to Option C:\n- First row: 3,4,9,1,8,5,7,6,2. Good.\n- Second row: 1,5,7,6,3,2,4,9,8. No duplicates here.\n- Third row:2,6,8,7,4,9,1,5,3. All unique.\n- Fourth row:4,7,1,2,5,6,3,8,9. No issues.\n- Fifth row:8,3,5,9,7,4,6,2,1. All good.\n- Sixth row:9,2,6,3,1,8,5,7,2. Wait, I see two 2s at the end. So, the sixth row has duplicates, making Option C invalid.\n\nFinally, Option D:\n- First row: 3,4,9,1,8,5,7,6,2. Looks good.\n- Second row:1,5,7,6,3,2,4,9,8. No duplicates.\n- Third row:2,6,8,7,4,9,1,5,3. All unique.\n- Fourth row:4,7,1,2,5,6,3,8,9. No issues.\n- Fifth row:8,3,5,9,7,4,6,2,1. All good.\n- Sixth row:9,2,6,3,1,8,5,7,4. No duplicates.\n- Seventh row:7,1,2,8,6,3,9,4,5. All unique.\n- Eighth row:6,8,4,5,9,1,2,3,7. No issues.\n- Ninth row:5,9,3,4,2,7,8,1,6. All numbers once.\n\nNow, I need to check the columns for Option D.\n\nFirst column:3,1,2,4,8,9,7,6,5. All unique.\nSecond column:4,5,6,7,3,2,1,8,9. No duplicates.\nThird column:9,7,8,1,5,6,2,4,3. All good.\nFourth column:1,6,7,2,9,3,8,5,4. No duplicates.\nFifth column:8,3,4,5,7,1,6,9,2. All numbers present once.\nSixth column:5,2,9,6,4,8,3,1,7. Let me check: 5,2,9,6,4,8,3,1,7. All unique, no duplicates.\nSeventh column:7,4,1,3,6,5,9,2,8. All unique.\nEighth column:6,9,5,8,2,7,4,3,1. No duplicates.\nNinth column:2,8,3,9,1,4,5,7,6. All unique.\n\nNow, let me check the 3x3 subgrids for Option D.\n\nFirst subgrid (top-left):\n3,4,9\n1,5,7\n2,6,8\nWait, that's the first three rows. Let me list the numbers: 3,4,9,1,5,7,2,6,8. All numbers from 1-9 once. Good.\n\nSecond subgrid (top-middle):\n1,8,5\n6,3,9\n7,4,9. Wait, hold on. Wait, no, the subgrids are 3x3. Let me get the correct cells.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me list the subgrids properly.\n\nFirst subgrid (rows 1-3, columns 1-3):\n3,4,9\n1,5,7\n2,6,8\nNumbers: 3,4,9,1,5,7,2,6,8. All present once. Good.\n\nSecond subgrid (rows 1-3, columns 4-6):\n1,8,5\n6,3,9\n7,4,9. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, rows 1-3, columns 4-6:\n\nRow 1:1,8,5\nRow 2:6,3,9\nRow 3:7,4,9\nWait, in row 3, column 6 is 9, but row 2, column 6 is 9 as well. So, duplicates in this subgrid. That's a problem. Wait, but in Option D, let me check again.\n\nWait, in Option D, the second subgrid (columns 4-6, rows 1-3) would be:\n\nRow 1:1,8,5\nRow 2:6,3,2\nRow 3:7,4,9\n\nWait, no, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me look again.\n\nOption D's grid:\n\nRow 1:3 4 9 | 1 8 5 |7 6 2\nRow 2:1 5 7 |6 3 2 |4 9 8\nRow 3:2 6 8 |7 4 9 |1 5 3\nRow 4:4 7 1 |2 5 6 |3 8 9\nRow 5:8 3 5 |9 7 4 |6 2 1\nRow 6:9 2 6 |3 1 8 |5 7 4\nRow 7:7 1 2 |8 6 3 |9 4 5\nRow 8:6 8 4 |5 9 1 |2 3 7\nRow 9:5 9 3 |4 2 7 |8 1 6\n\nSo, the second subgrid (columns 4-6, rows 1-3):\n\nRow 1:1,8,5\nRow 2:6,3,2\nRow 3:7,4,9\n\nSo, numbers in this subgrid: 1,8,5,6,3,2,7,4,9. All unique. Good.\n\nThird subgrid (rows 1-3, columns 7-9):\n\n7,6,2\n4,9,8\n1,5,3\n\nNumbers:7,6,2,4,9,8,1,5,3. All present once. Good.\n\nFourth subgrid (rows 4-6, columns 1-3):\n\n4,7,1\n8,3,5\n9,2,6\n\nNumbers:4,7,1,8,3,5,9,2,6. All unique. Good.\n\nFifth subgrid (rows 4-6, columns 4-6):\n\n2,5,6\n9,7,4\n3,1,8\n\nNumbers:2,5,6,9,7,4,3,1,8. All present once. Good.\n\nSixth subgrid (rows 4-6, columns 7-9):\n\n3,8,9\n6,2,1\n5,7,4\n\nNumbers:3,8,9,6,2,1,5,7,4. All unique. Good.\n\nSeventh subgrid (rows 7-9, columns 1-3):\n\n7,1,2\n6,8,4\n5,9,3\n\nNumbers:7,1,2,6,8,4,5,9,3. All present once. Good.\n\nEighth subgrid (rows 7-9, columns 4-6):\n\n8,6,3\n5,9,1\n4,2,7\n\nNumbers:8,6,3,5,9,1,4,2,7. All unique. Good.\n\nNinth subgrid (rows 7-9, columns 7-9):\n\n9,4,5\n2,3,7\n8,1,6\n\nNumbers:9,4,5,2,3,7,8,1,6. All present once. Good.\n\nSo, after checking all rows, columns, and subgrids for Option D, I don't see any duplicates.
