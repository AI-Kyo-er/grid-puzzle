{"question_id": "binairo_223", "response": "Okay, so I need to solve this Binairo puzzle. It's a 4x4 grid, and each cell has to be either 0 or 1. Let me remember the rules:\n\n1. No more than two consecutive identical numbers in any row or column. So no 000 or 111 anywhere.\n2. Each row and column must have an equal number of 0s and 1s. Since it's 4x4, each row and column should have exactly two 0s and two 1s.\n3. No two rows can be identical, and no two columns can be identical either.\n\nLooking at the options, I need to check each one against these rules. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nStarting with Option A:\n```\n0 0 1 1\n0 1 0 1\n1 0 1 0\n1 1 0 0\n```\nFirst, checking for consecutive numbers. Let's look at each row:\n- Row 1: 0,0,1,1. That has two 0s followed by two 1s. That's okay because it's exactly two consecutive, not three.\n- Row 2: 0,1,0,1. No consecutive duplicates here, so that's good.\n- Row 3: 1,0,1,0. Also no consecutive duplicates.\n- Row 4: 1,1,0,0. Again, two 1s followed by two 0s, which is allowed.\n\nNow checking columns:\n- Column 1: 0,0,1,1. Two 0s followed by two 1s. Good.\n- Column 2: 0,1,0,1. No consecutive duplicates.\n- Column 3: 1,0,1,0. No consecutive duplicates.\n- Column 4: 1,1,0,0. Two 1s and then two 0s. Good.\n\nNext, each row and column should have two 0s and two 1s. Let's check:\n- Row 1: 2 zeros, 2 ones. Good.\n- Row 2: 2 zeros, 2 ones. Good.\n- Row 3: 2 zeros, 2 ones. Good.\n- Row 4: 2 zeros, 2 ones. Good.\n\nColumns:\n- Column 1: 2 zeros, 2 ones. Good.\n- Column 2: 2 zeros, 2 ones. Good.\n- Column 3: 2 zeros, 2 ones. Good.\n- Column 4: 2 zeros, 2 ones. Good.\n\nNow, checking for identical rows and columns. Looking at the rows:\n- Row 1: 0 0 1 1\n- Row 2: 0 1 0 1\n- Row 3: 1 0 1 0\n- Row 4: 1 1 0 0\nNone of these rows are identical, which is good.\n\nColumns:\n- Column 1: 0,0,1,1\n- Column 2: 0,1,0,1\n- Column 3: 1,0,1,0\n- Column 4: 1,1,0,0\nNone of the columns are identical either. So Option A seems to satisfy all the rules.\n\nBut let me check the other options just to be sure.\n\nOption B:\n```\n1 0 1 1\n0 1 0 1\n1 0 1 0\n1 1 0 0\n```\nCheck rows:\n- Row 1: 1,0,1,1. Ends with two 1s, which is allowed.\n- Row 2: 0,1,0,1. Good.\n- Row 3: 1,0,1,0. Good.\n- Row 4: 1,1,0,0. Good.\n\nColumns:\n- Column 1: 1,0,1,1. This has 1,0,1,1. The last two are 1s, so two consecutive. That's okay.\n- Column 2: 0,1,0,1. Good.\n- Column 3: 1,0,1,0. Good.\n- Column 4: 1,1,0,0. Good.\n\nNow, counts:\n- Each row has two 0s and two 1s. Let's check:\n  - Row 1: 2 ones, 2 zeros? Wait, 1,0,1,1 has three 1s. Oh, that's a problem. It has three 1s and one 0. That violates rule 3 because each row must have exactly two 0s and two 1s. So Option B is invalid.\n\nMoving on to Option C:\n```\n0 0 1 1\n0 1 0 1\n1 0 0 0\n1 1 0 0\n```\nCheck rows:\n- Row 1: 0,0,1,1. Good.\n- Row 2: 0,1,0,1. Good.\n- Row 3: 1,0,0,0. Here, the last three are 0s. That's three in a row, which violates rule 1. So Option C is invalid.\n\nOption D:\n```\n0 0 1 1\n0 1 0 1\n1 0 1 0\n1 1 0 1\n```\nCheck rows:\n- Row 1: 0,0,1,1. Good.\n- Row 2: 0,1,0,1. Good.\n- Row 3: 1,0,1,0. Good.\n- Row 4: 1,1,0,1. Ends with two 1s followed by a 0 and another 1. Wait, let's look at the last three: 1,0,1. That's okay, no three in a row. But let's check the counts.\n\nEach row should have two 0s and two 1s. Let's check Row 4: 1,1,0,1. That's three 1s and one 0. So it violates rule 3. Therefore, Option D is invalid.\n\nSo, after checking all options, only Option A satisfies all the Binairo rules without any violations.\n</think>\n\nThe correct answer is Option A, as it adheres to all Binairo rules without any violations.\n\n\\boxed{A}", "ground_truth": "A", "prompt": "You need to solve a Binairo puzzle (Size: 4x4).You need to solve a Binairo puzzle.\n\n**Binairo Puzzle Rules:**\n1.

{"question_id": "kakuro_191", "response": "Okay, so I have this 3x3 Kakuro puzzle to solve. Let me start by recalling the rules.
